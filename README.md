OpenShift Origin - Platform as a Service
========================================

This repository contains the core components of the OpenShift service
released under the [OpenShift Origin source
project](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/open-source).  The
components in this repository are sufficient to self host an OpenShift
instance -- [download a LiveCD image with everything
preconfigured](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/opensource/download) or
[read more about running OpenShift
locally](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/build-your-own) on
our wiki.

Architecturally OpenShift is split into the following core subsystems:

*   __Node__
    Hosted applications are run in isolated containers on each node -
the system can operate many nodes at any one time.
*   __Broker__
    Central service exposing a REST API for consumers and coordinating
with each node.
*   __Console__
    Web management console using the REST API to allow users to easily 
create and manage applications.
*   __Messaging System__
    Communication pipeline between the broker and each node.
*   __User Authentication__
    Pluggable authentication for controlling access to the broker
*   __Domain Name Management__
    Each hosted application receives a unique domain name to simplify
SSL termination and deployment

A [comprehensive architecture

can be found on our wiki.

The primary command line interface to OpenShift is [RHC](https://github.com/openshift/rhc).
