.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoo-diagnostics\fP is a utility for detecting and diagnosing common problems with OpenShift hosts.
.PP
The tests are adapted to what is installed on the host. It is intended
to run on all hosts in an OpenShift installation to assist with
troubleshooting installations and upgrades.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP|\fB--help\fP
Display a simple help dialog.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP|\fB--verbose\fP
Display informational messages while running tests, rather than just displaying
(by default) warnings and errors.
.TP
.B
\fB-w\fP|\fB--wait\fP <seconds>
When run on a broker host, some tests make MCollective calls to probe all node
hosts. This sets the timeout for responses (by default 2 seconds). If a host
does not respond in this time, its response is ignored. Depending on network
topology, often half a second or less is adequate; however, if node hosts are
reported missing, increasing the value may help accommodate slower responses.
.TP

\fB-o\fP|\fB--abortok\fP
It is possible for initial testing to indicate an installation severely impaired
enough to abort further testing. In this case testing halts automatically to
focus attention on the main problem, rather than letting that report scroll off
due to related test failures. If, however, you really want to run all relevant
tests when testing would normally abort, use this option.
.SH EXAMPLE

Simple usage on any host:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # oo-diagnostics

.fam T
.fi
Make it less boring by displaying the tests running and other information:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # oo-diagnostics --verbose

.fam T
.fi
Just re-run a single test rather than the whole set:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # oo-diagnostics test_broker_accept_scripts

.fam T
.fi
