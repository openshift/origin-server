# Supplimental Documentation Guidelines

The files in this directory aim to provide links into the code to which is
always the ultimate authority on how things work.  The goal is __not__ to
duplicate the wealth of knowledge available on the internet or the various
README files in the package directories but merely to be a tool for assisting
the developer to understand where to look to find out more information.

Ideally to be included in this directory the document should:

* be less than < 750 words
* deal with a subject that touches multiple OpenShift packages or libraries

Developers are encouraged to ship documentation with their code in the of
READMEs or inlined for generation with yard.  That said, we realize there a
handful of systems in OpenShift whose functionality is distributed amongst
several packages and in those cases documenting the relationships at this level
is helpful.
