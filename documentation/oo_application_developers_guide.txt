This guide provides information relevant to application developers who wish to integrate their code with OpenShift and the cartridges which drive their applications.

The link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html[Cartridge Developers Guide] also contains helpful information for application developers who desire a more complete understanding of cartridges and their interaction with application code.

== Environment Variables
OpenShift builds the execution environment which is made available to application scripts and other code. The environment contains a variety of variables related to OpenShift and the application itself which can only be determined at runtime. In addition to the standard environment variables exposed to the application, cartridges may also expose custom variables for the application to consume; consult the specific cartridge documentation for more information about what the cartridge makes available.

=== Standard OpenShift Environment Variables
The following is a comprehensive list of the predefined environment variables available regardless of the cartridges in use for a given application.

* `HOME` alias for `OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR`
* `HISTFILE` bash history file
* `OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS` the application's fully qualified domain name that your cartridge is a part of
* `OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME` the validated user assigned name for the application. Black list is system dependent.
* `OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID` OpenShift assigned UUID for the application
* `OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR` the directory where your cartridge may store data
* `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DNS` the gear's fully qualified domain name that your cartridge is a part of. May or may not be equal to `OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS`
* `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME` OpenShift assigned name for the gear. May or may not be equal to `OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME`
* `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID` OpenShift assigned UUID for the gear
* `OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR` OpenShift assigned directory for the gear
* `OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR` the directory where the developer's application is "archived" to and will be run from.
* `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR` the directory where your cartridge may store temporary data
* `TMPDIR` alias for `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR`
* `TMP` alias for `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR`

=== Cartridge-Specific Environment Variables
Although cartridges may expose further arbitrarily named environment variables, there are several variables which are generated by OpenShift for every cartridge based on well-defined standards incorporating cartridge metadata.

To learn more about these variables, consult the following pieces of documentation from the Cartridge Author guide.

* link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#environment-variables[Environment Variables]

== Application Action Hooks
OpenShift provides application developers entry points into various application and platform lifecycle operations. These entry points are referred to as "action hooks", and have a special location within the application's Git repository:

----
<repository>/.openshift/action_hooks
----

During any OpenShift process which supports an action hook, the application action hook directory will be checked for an executable file matching the specified name. If such a file is present, it will be executed before returning control to the process.

Unless otherwise documented, OpenShift generally imposes no implementation requirement on action hooks other than they be executable files.

These scripts will be executed by the system directly. See link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#notes-on-script-execution[Notes on Script Execution] in the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html[Cartridge Developers Guide] for more information.

=== Cartridge Control Action Hooks
Cartridges implement a standard set of named control actions which allow them to function within OpenShift. Each time OpenShift invokes one of these cartridge actions, a standard set of application action hooks are executed to give the application developer an opportunity to integrate more closely with specific cartridges.

The following is a list of all possible action hooks executed in association with a single cartridge control action. For each control action, a set of `pre` and `post` action hooks surround the control action. In the action hook names, `{Name}` refers to the `Name` cartridge manifest element.

* `start` control action:
** `pre_start`
** `pre_start_{Name}` footnoteref:[1,Hook is assumed to be a shell script which is `sourced` in the same execution as the action it relates to; this facilitates the modification of the control action's environment (e.g. via `export` statements).]
** `post_start`
** `post_start_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
* `stop` control action:
** `pre_stop`
** `pre_stop_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
** `post_stop`
** `post_stop_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
* `reload` control action:
** `pre_reload`
** `pre_reload_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
** `post_reload`
** `post_reload_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
* `restart` control action:
** `pre_restart`
** `pre_restart_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
** `post_restart`
** `post_restart_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
* `tidy` control action:
** `pre_tidy`
** `pre_tidy_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]
** `post_tidy`
** `post_tidy_{Name}` footnoteref:[1]

For details about the control actions (including what they represent and when they are called), refer to the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#bin-control[control script
documentation] in the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html[Cartridge Developers Guide] guide.

=== Build Action Hooks
During a Git push, applications using the default OpenShift build lifecycle are given an opportunity to participate in the build/deploy workflow via another set of action hooks. The workflow and sequence of actions for the build lifecycle is described in detail in the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#openshift-builds[OpenShift Builds] section of the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html[Cartridge Developers Guide] guide.

The list of action hooks supported during the default build lifecycle are:

* `pre_build`
* `build`
* `deploy`
* `post_deploy`

Refer to the link:oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#openshift-builds[OpenShift Builds] guide for details about when these action hooks are invoked.

=== Custom Cartridge Action Hooks
Cartridges may support custom action hooks available to application developers. Consult the documentation for individual cartridges to learn which hooks are supported and how to correctly implement them.
