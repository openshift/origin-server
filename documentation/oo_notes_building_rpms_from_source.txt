This guide will walk you through retrieving the OpenShift Origin source from GitHub and build local copies of the Origin RPMS.

OpenShift Origin requires a Fedora 19, or RHEL 6.4 compatible system to build these packages. You should start with a minimal installation to perform the build.

*1. Install basic dependencies (Requires root to install RPMs)*

----
yum install -y rubygem-thor git tito yum-plugin-priorities wget vim-enhanced \
ruby-devel rubygems-devel rubygem-aws-sdk rubygem-parseconfig rubygem-yard rubygem-redcarpet \
createrepo
----

*2. Clone the openshift-dev-tools repository*

----
git clone git://github.com/openshift/origin-dev-tools.git
----
    
*3. Clone the OpenShift Origin sources*

----
# From origin-dev-tools's checkout
export SKIP_SETUP=1
./build/devenv clone_addtl_repos master
----

*4. Install package requirements (Requires root to install RPMs)*

----
# From origin-dev-tools's checkout
# This step will install a lot of RPMs and will take a while
./build/devenv install_required_packages
----

*5. Build RPMs (Requires root to install RPMs)*

----
# From origin-dev-tools's checkout
./build/devenv local-build --skip-install
----

RPMs will be available in `origin-rpms` directory.

*6. Create RPM metadata so that the directory can be accessed as a YUM repository*

----
# From the origin-rpms directory
createrepo .
