The `oo-install` utility is designed to ease the experience of a trial or basic OpenShift installation by interactively gathering the data to run a simple deployment. The current iteration of `oo-install` enables the configuration and deployment of OpenShift according to the following scenarios:

* Deploy all OpenShift components to one or more hosts
* Add a new node host to an existing OpenShift deployment

WARNING: `oo-install` is a deployment tool that has been optimized to simplify the process of getting a running OpenShift system on your chosen host systems. If you want to use OpenShift with an existing MongoDB database, ActiveMQ server, or DNS server, check out the link:oo_deployment_guide_comprehensive.html[Comprehensive Deployment Guide] instead.

==== Do I Have To Read a Manual?
In short, no. One of the design goals of the `oo-install` utility is to make this document completely unnecessary. If you are feeling bold, you are heartily encouraged to attempt to use the installer right now without any additionaly guidance. Check out https://install.openshift.com/ for the quick rundown on how to get started. If you run into problems, head back here or send your questions and feedback to the mailing lists or IRC channels mentioned on the oo-install web page.

[float]
==== Source Code
The locations for the source code of this document and the `oo-install` utility are as follows:

* This document: https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/documentation/oo_install_users_guide.adoc
* `oo-install`: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/tree/master/oo-install

== Before You Begin
This section covers some topics that will help you to have a successful OpenShift deployment. If you have jumped straight in with https://install.openshift.com/ and are having problems, look over this section to make sure you've got the basics covered.

=== The Base OS Setup
When you install Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, you will be given the option to select a starting set of packages:

image:os_minimal_install.png[image]

*Be sure to select the "Minimal" installation.* This will ensure that the system does not contain any package incompatibilities with OpenShift.

=== Utility Prerequisites
This section explains the utilities that you will need to install on the various hosts that may be involved in your OpenShift installation. Install these before you run `oo-install` to avoid having to go back and set them up later.

If you find a host system that is missing one of these required utilities, you can use `yum` to search for an appropriate RPM by running:

----
$ yum provides '*/<utility>'
----

Where "$$<utility>$$" is the name of the utility that you are looking to install.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a Linux distribution that does not ship with `yum` and can't do software updates with `yum`, then chances are good this installer is not going to work for you.

==== On the `oo-install` Host
You can run the OpenShift installer from any computer that has the following utilities installed:

* ruby (1.8.7 or greater)
* curl
* unzip

[NOTE]
====
The installer itself is designed to run pretty much anywhere, but if you are running the installer on the same host where you will be installing OpenShift, make sure you also look at the link:#on-the-target-hosts[Target Host requirements]. If you are doing an OpenShift Origin installation, also be sure to check out the link:#origin-specific-utilities[Origin-specific requirements].
====

On most systems, you can install the base installer requirements by running:

----
$ yum install ruby unzip curl
----

If you want to run `oo-install` against a remote target host, you will also need the `ssh` client.

==== On the Target Hosts
The host systems where you will be installing OpenShift will need to have the following utilities:

* yum
* getenforce (part of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux[SELinux])

NOTE: SELinux must be running in _Enforcing_ mode or _Permissive_ mode on every host system where OpenShift components will be installed.

==== Origin-Specific Utilities
If you are installing OpenShift Origin, you will also need to install the following utilities on your target host systems:

* On all target hosts:
** http://puppetlabs.com/[puppet]
** augtool
* On your Broker host:
** dnssec-keygen
** htpasswd

NOTE: Additionally you will need to _remove_ `firewalld`. Origin uses a proxy that is incompatible with firewalld.

*OpenShift Origin on RHEL and Derivatives* +
If you are installing OpenShift Origin on RHEL6 or a derivative distribution (such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.), you will need to set up two additional requirements on those host systems:

* The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F[EPEL yum repository]
* The ruby193 http://developerblog.redhat.com/2013/01/28/software-collections-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux/[software collection (SCL)]

To manually add the yum repos for EPEL and the ruby193 SCL, you can run the following commands as root on your target hosts.

.EPEL
----
$ wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm <1>
$ rpm -Uvh epel-release-6*.rpm
----
<1> Replace `x86_64` with `i386` for 32-bit systems

.ruby193 SCL
----
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/openshift-origin-deps.repo <<"EOF"
[openshift-origin-deps]
name=OpenShift Origin Dependencies - EL6
baseurl=https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-origin/nightly/rhel-6/dependencies/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
EOF
----

With the OpenShift Origin Dependencies repo set up, you can now install ruby 1.9.3 as follows and the oo-install script will utilize it where necessary.

----
$ yum install ruby193-ruby
----

=== Where Should I Run This?
The `oo-install` utility can run on _any_ system that meets the minimum prerequisites link:#on-the-code-oo-install-code-host[mentioned above]. This is important to understand, because while you _can_ run the installer from your intended Broker host, you could just as easily run it from your own computer (as long as you have SSH access to the target host). As you are answering the installer's questions about where your Broker lives, it is actually useful to think of it the way that other hosts would see it, even if you are running the installer from the system where an OpenShift component will live.

[TIP]
====
*Remote Installation* +
If you are running the installer locally, but your OpenShift deployment will be installed on a remote system, you will need passwordless SSH access to your target host(s). "Passwordless" here means that either you are using an SSH key pair that was generated without a password, or that you are using a password manager like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent[ssh-agent] to provide the password as necessary.
====

== Running the Installer
The `oo-install` utility has been developed to function as a standalone application. However, the easiest way to run it is by using a "curl-to-shell" command to download and execute the latest version of the installer in a single step. This section describes running the curl-to-shell command and also how to run the installer from the source code.

=== install.openshift.com
The recommended method for installing OpenShift is via a "curl-to-shell" command. From your command line, just run

----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/)
----

If you want to pass arguments to the installer, include them after the whole command:

----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/) -e -s rhsm -u user@company.com
----

By default, the installer runs in Origin mode. If you want to install OpenShift Enterprise, you can either run:

----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/) -e
----

...or...

----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/ose/)
----

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift Enterprise installations require access to Red Hat Subscription Manager or Red Hat Network, and are verified to succeed on hosts running under a current Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription.
====

=== Portable Installer
You can download a version of the online installer for use on a CD or USB drive. The latest versions of the portable packages are available at:

* OpenShift Origin Portable: https://install.openshift.com/portable/oo-install-origin.zip
* OpenShift Enterprise Portable: https://install.openshift.com/portable/oo-install-ose.zip

To use these portable installers:

1. Download and unzip the portable installer zip file.
2. Copy or burn the unzipped files to a USB drive or CD-ROM, respectively.
3. Refer to the included README for instructions on starting the installation from the provided launcher.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that even if you are using the portable installer, your target hosts systems may still require internet access for necessary OpenShift RPMs.
====

=== Running oo-install from source
If you are working on `oo-install` development, you can also run the installer directly from source:

1. Clone the openshift-extras repo from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras.git`
2. `cd openshift-extras/oo-install`
3. `bundle install` (You only need to do this the first time)
4. `bundle exec bin/oo-install`

Because `oo-install` is built to support remote deployments, you don't need to set up a development environment on a target system in order to do this; you can clone the repo locally and run installations against remote systems directly from there.

=== Installer Command-Line Options
The complete list of options is as follows:

----
-a, --advanced-mode              Enable access to message server and db server customization.
-c, --config-file FILEPATH       The path to an alternate config file
-w, --workflow WORKFLOW_ID       The installer workflow for unattended deployment.
-l, --list-workflows             List workflow IDs available for use with unattended deployment.
-e, --enterprise-mode            Show OpenShift Enterprise options (ignored in unattended mode)
-s, --subscription-type TYPE     The software source for installation packages.
-u, --username USERNAME          Red Hat Login username
-p, --password PASSWORD          Red Hat Login password
-d, --debug                      Enable debugging messages
----

==== -a / --advanced-mode
By default, the installation utility will automatically install http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] and http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] on the same system that you designate as the OpenShift Broker. If you would prefer to install these services on different hosts systems, pass the '-a' flag and you will br prompted to provide information on these other target systems. For more on "deployment roles", see the link:#roles-summarized[Roles Summarized] below.

==== -c / --config-file FILEPATH
The installer will look for a configuration file at the default location `~/.openshift/oo-install-cfg.yml`. If you want to use a different file, you can pass the filepath with this option. If the file that you specify does not exist, it will automatically be created with some basic settings.

==== -w / --workflow WORKFLOW_ID
If you have already configured a complete OpenShift deployment, you can run the installer without any user interaction by providing this argument and the ID of an installer workflow. For example, you can run the OpenShift full deployment workflow like this:

----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/) -w origin_deploy
----

When you run the command this way, the installer will sanity check your deployment configuration, and if everything looks good it will run the specified workflow automatically.

==== -l / --list-workflows
In order to use the `-w` option, you will need to see a list of the valid workflow IDs that are available. When you run the installer with this flag, it will print out the valid list of IDs and descriptions of each associated workflow.

NOTE: The list of available workflow IDs will be different depending on if you are performing an OpenShift Origin installation or an OpenShift Enterprise installation. See the `-e` options for more on this.

==== -e / --enterprise-mode
In default mode, the installer will provide you with options for installing or extending an OpenShift Origin deployment. However, the same installer can be used to deploy OpenShift Enterprise by setting this switch.

==== -s / --subscription-type TYPE
_Subscription_ refers to where your openshift component RPMs are coming from. `oo-install` supports four options:

* *none* - If you have manually configured yum repos on the target hosts, and those repos already include the OpenShift RPMs, the 'none' value tells the installer to use what you have already set up.
* *yum* - Indicates that you would like the installer to create new yum repo entries for you under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
* *rhsm* - (For OpenShift Enterprise) Tells the installer that you want to use Red Hat Subscription Manager to set up OpenShift software channels
* *rhn* - (For OpenShift Enterprise) Tells the installer that you want to use Red Hat Network to set up OpenShift software channels

The '-s' option exists to enable you to override the installer config file from the command line. This would typically be done in concert with the '-w' option as part of the setup for an unattended installation. For more information on subscriptions see link:#subscription[Subscription], below.

==== -u / --username USERNAME
As indicated in the explanation of the '-s' option above, this option exists to enable you to override the installer config file from the command line. Currently, the '-u' setting is only meaningful in a scenario where you would be running an unattended installation (see '-w') of OpenShift Enterprise (see '-e') using the 'rhsm' or 'rhn' subscription methods.

==== -p / --password PASSWORD
See the comments on the '-u' option; this option would only be used under the same conditions.

==== -d / --debug
Enabling 'debug' mode will cause the installer to periodically dump out large volumes of information about the SSH sessions that it attempts to establish as it runs. This can be useful for debugging remote deployments.

== Configuring Your Deployment
When you run the installer for the first time, you will be asked to describe a number of items related to the OpenShift deployment that you want to set up. This whole process should be pretty self-explanatory, but here are some notes about the three main facets of the configuration process.

=== DNS
When you use `oo-install` to deploy OpenShift, the installer configures a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND[BIND] server to run on the same host where the Broker will run. The primary function of this BIND instance is to provide lookup information for applications that are created by the users of your OpenShift system.

==== Registering OpenShift Hosts with the OpenShift DNS Instance
Depending on your lab setup, you may already have a DNS solution in place for your host systems. If not, you can opt to register your OpenShift hosts with the Broker's BIND server. This enables the hosts to look each other up by name in an environment where they may not be able to do name lookups otherwise.

When the installer asks you:

----
Do you want to register DNS entries for your OpenShift hosts with the same OpenShift DNS service that will be managing DNS records for the hosted applications?
----

...answering 'yes' will notify the installer that you want this registration to be done. If you _do_ answer yes, you will be asked a followup question:

----
What domain do you want to use for the OpenShift hosts?
----

While it is possible for you to answer this question with the same domain that you are using for OpenShift-hosted applications, it is recommended that you use a different domain.

For instance, if your domain is "mycompany.com", you might use:

* `apps.mycompany.com` for your OpenShift applications domain and
* `openshift.mycompany.com` for your OpenShift hosts domain

==== Interacting with the OpenShift DNS Instance
After installation, the Broker-based DNS server can be used separately from a larger DNS infrastructure, or easily configured to work in concert with one. See the link:#post-install-tasks[Post-Install Tasks] section for more on this.

=== Host and Roles
After you have set the DNS configuration, you will be guided through the process of describing the hosts where OpenShift will be installed.

`oo-install` sees OpenShift deployments as a collection of hosts that have been assigned to certain roles. All of the roles can be assigned to a single host (an "all-in-one" deployment), or they can be distributed each to a different host.

==== Roles Summarized
There are four roles that a host can perform in an OpenShift deployment: Broker, DBServer, MsgServer and Node.

===== Broker
The Broker role consists of the OpenShift Broker RPMs, an MCollective client, and a BIND DNS service. The host where the Broker is installed is the central hub of the OpenShift deployment, and provides a web interface where users can manage their hosted applications. Currently, one Broker per deployment is supported by `oo-install`.

===== DBServer
This role consists of the MongoDB database that the Broker uses to track users and applications. Currently, one DBServer per deployment is supported by `oo-install`.

===== MsgServer
The MsgServer role comprises the ActiveMQ server plus an MCollective client. Currently, one MsgServer per deployment is supported by `oo-install`.

===== Node
The Node role is assigned to any host that will actually be used to store and serve OpenShift-hosted applications. `oo-install` supports the deployment of multiple Nodes during an installation, and a separate workflow supports the ability to add a new Node to an existing OpenShift deployment.

==== OpenShift Hosts
The installer is going to guide you through the process of gathering the following information about each host that you are going to use in your deployment.

===== Host Name
This should be pretty self-explanatory. The installer is looking for the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host. If you provided an OpenShift hosts domain during link:#dns[DNS] configuration, you can get away with typing just the hostname here and the installer will append the rest for you.

[NOTE]
====
*Why can't I use `localhost` here?* +
If you only ever wanted to deploy an all-in-one OpenShift system, you could use `localhost` in all of the OpenShift configuration files. However, adding Nodes to an all-in-one deployment would require the revision of all of the configuration files to use the Broker's FQDN. Consequently the installer prevents the assignment of `localhost` as the hostname value for any OpenShift host.
====

===== SSH Host Name
If the host in question is not the host where you are running the installer, this field enables you to specify the name of the SSH target for remote installation. This value can be:

* An IP address
* A DNS name that already resolves to the host
* Identical to the Host Name
* An alias from your `~/.ssh/config` file
* `localhost`

When you set the value of the SSH Host Name to `localhost`, you are telling the installer that you are running `oo-install` on the host that you are currently describing. In this case, `oo-install` will not use SSH to interact with this host instance, but will attempt to run the commands locally. Otherwise, `oo-install` will use this value in conjunction with the User value to start SSH sessions with this host.

===== User
When the host that you are currently describing is a remote system, this value is used in conjunction with the SSH Host Name to establish SSH sessions with the target host. If you are running the installer on the target host itself (in other words, if you are using SSH Host Name `localhost` for this host instance), then you will not be asked this question; the installation will run with whatever privileges your user account has.

In either case, the user in question must satisfy one of these two requirements:

* Be `root` or
* Have http://serverfault.com/questions/160581/how-to-setup-passwordless-sudo-on-linux[passwordless sudo] privileges on the target system

[TIP]
====
Under RHEL, passwordless sudo configuration may not succeeed unless you set the following in your `/etc/sudoers` file for your target user:

----
Defaults:<username>    !requiretty
----

Try setting this if you see error messages like:

----
sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo
----
====

===== IP Address
At this point, the installer will attempt to look up the IP addresses that have been assigned to the host that you are currently describing. In a situation where the host has multiple NICs, there may be multiple IP addresses to choose from.

_Non-Node Hosts_ +
The IP address that is provided here should be the one that would be used by _other OpenShift hosts_ would use to connect with this host.

_Node Hosts_ +
In the case of Node hosts, you will want to use the IP address that _client systems_ would use to reach the host.

_Manual Entry_ +
You also have the option of supplying a completely different IP address. This may be necessary in situations where one OpenShift host is separated from the others in a NAT environment.

[NOTE]
====
_IP Address and DNS Registration_ +
If you have told the installer to link:#registering-openshift-hosts-with-the-openshift-dns-instance[register your OpenShift host names with the OpenShift DNS instance], this IP address will be used as the resolution of this hostname.
====

===== IP Interface
This value is only collected for Node hosts in OpenShift Origin deployments. This is a requirement of the underlying Puppet infrastructure. If you select one of the IP address / IP interface combos that `oo-install` finds on the host, you will not need to provide this at all. On the other hand, if you manually configure the IP address, you will also need to manually specify the interface. To see the available IP interfaces on a given host, you can run this command:

----
$ ip link show
----

Which will yield output like this:

----
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT 
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: em1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
    link/ether f0:de:f1:de:88:0f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
    link/ether 24:77:03:64:a9:28 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
----

Or you can run:

----
$ ip addr list
----

Which will additionally provide each interfaces current IP address assignment (if applicable):

----
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN 
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether f1:f1:f1:f1:f1:f1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
----

==== Basic and Advanced Role Deployment
By default, the installer runs in 'basic' mode. In basic mode, the installer automatically assigns the link:#dbserver[DBServer] and link:#msgserver[MsgServer] roles to the same host where the Broker is assigned. If you need more flexibility, you can be override 'basic' mode by passing the link:#a-advanced-mode[-a] argument to the installer command.

[NOTE]
====
*Moving Roles Between Hosts* +
Up until the point where you actually deploy the OpenShift configuration that you are describing, you will have the opportunity to move roles between the host instances that you have defined. In 'basic' mode, moving the Broker role implicitly moves the DBServer and MsgServer roles, as well.
====

=== Subscription
At this point, all that remains to configure your OpenShift deployment is to tell `oo-install` where you would like to get your OpenShift RPMs from. Refer to the notes on the link:#s-subscription-type-type[-s / --subscription-type] command-line argument for an explanation of your options.

The installer supports three different ways to set subscription preferences. This is great from a deployment flexibility perspective, but may be really confusing if this is your first time through an OpenShift deployment.

==== Pathway #1 - Command Line Options
The first way to set subscription preferences is via the command line. This option works well if you are building an unattended installation system and you want to dyanamically set this information. The settings provided at the command line will trump any conflicting settings from the installer config file. But if you are _not_ running an unattended installation, you'll still have the opportunity to override these values. Bottom line: don't set subscription information on the command line unless you are using it in conjunction with an unattended installation (see the link:#w-workflow-workflow_id[-w] command line argument for more information).

==== Pathway #2 - Configuration File Options
Most commonly, you will just want to store subscription information in the installer config file. The main advantage to this is that you can reuse the subscription settings every time you configure a deployment. The main disadvantage to this is that you could potentially end up storing a piece of sensitive information (your RHSM or RHN password) to a cleartext file. In these situations, you will want to use a combination of this pathway and pathway #3; read on for more info.

WARNING: Information that is stored in the `oo-install` configuration file is not encrypted. If you are using a subscription method that requires a user name and password, it is recommended that you omit the password from the configuration file. To do this, enter $$'-'$$ as your password when the installer asks.

==== Pathway #3 - Runtime Options
After the installer gives you the opportunity to work with subscription settings in your configuration file, you will have the opportunity to set one-time values that are _not_ stored in the configuration file. These values will be used during the current deployment and then forgotten by `oo-install`. This is suitable in particular for passwords that you do not want to capture in the non-encrypted installer config file.

==== Subscription Notes for OpenShift Origin
The most common subscription method for Origin is `yum`, and the current known good repos to use are these:

* The base URL for the OpenShift repositories:
** For Fedora target systems: `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-origin/nightly/fedora-19`
** For RHEL6 target systems: `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-origin/nightly/rhel-6`
* The base URL for a Jenkins repository: `http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat`

[WARNING]
====
The installer provides the *Fedora* repo for the base URL in new configuration files. If you are:

* Installing OpenShift Origin onto RHEL hosts +
+
and +
+
* Using the "yum" subscription method

...then you will need to explicitily change your base URL value to the *RHEL* repo provided above.
====

== Pre-flight Checking and Installation
Once you've configured DNS, Hosts and Roles, and Subscription information, the installer will do a sanity check of the entire deployment. Specifically, for each host that you've described, the installer checks the following:

* Is the host reachable? (see link:#ssh-host-name[SSH Host Name])
* Does the user have the necessary privileges? (see link:#user[User])
* Is the host's system type supported by the installer?
* Does the host have the necessary utilities installed for the selected installation task? (see link:#utility-prerequisites[Utility Prerequisites])

=== Failing Pre-Flight?
If your deployment fails pre-flight, don't panic. Have a look at what the error messages are telling you about missing utilities and SSH connection issues (these are the largest causes of preflight failure).

TIP: It is completely safe to rerun the installer if it fails preflight, and if you are totally stumped, link:index.html#discussion-forums[get in touch with us so that we can help!]

=== Installing (Grab Some Tea)
Once the pre-flight inspection is complete, the installer hands control of the installation off to a $$'workflow executable'$$. The workflow executable's job is to transform the configuration that you've described into instructions for deploying your OpenShift. The entire installation process can take anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes. During the process, you will see a fairly constant stream of information scrolling by in your command terminal.

=== Reboot
When the process is completed, you will need to manually reboot the server(s) where you've deployed it. The recommended order is:

* DBServer
* MsgServer
* Broker
* Node(s)

In situations where more than one role resides on a given host, you only need to reboot that host once.

*Why doesn't `oo-install` reboot for me?* +
The main reason is that the installer was built to be mindful of production environments. If you happen to be installing OpenShift on hosts that are providing other mission-critical services, you probably want to defer that reboot until you can set up a low-impact maintenance window.

NOTE: Be aware that OpenShift will not work properly until the OpenShift hosts are rebooted.

== Post-Install Tasks
After the OpenShift installation is complete, you will need to make some DNS changes to interact with any OpenShift-hosted applications that you create. Here you have two options: a temporary, per-client solution or a permanent system-wide solution.

=== Temporary DNS Integration
These instructions will enable you to set up temporary DNS integration on a Linux system. You can use this information as a guideline for accomplishing similar results on client systems running other operating systems.

On a client-by-client basis, you can do the following to work against the OpenShift DNS server:

1. On the client system, make a backup copy of `/etc/resolv.conf` +
+
----
$ cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak
----
2. Open the file with a text editor +
+
----
$ vi /etc/resolv.conf
----
3. In the editor you will see something similar to this: +
+
----
domain mybu.mycorp.com
search mybu.mycorp.com mybu.mycorp.com. mycorp.com.
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.1.1.2
----
+
    * Modify the `domain` and `search` values to match the app domain (and optionally also the OpenShift host domain) that you specified. 
    * After the `search` line, insert a new `nameserver` entry to point to the Broker host's IP address.
    * Leave the other `nameserver` entries alone.

4. No restart necessary; you should be able to point a web browser on this client system at the URL off an application in the app domain. If you've also registered the OpenShift hosts with OpenShift DNS, they should be reachable by name as well.

[WARNING]
====
* Once modified to use the Broker DNS, your client system will not be able to resolve non-OpenShift-registered hostnames until it is reverted to its original settings.
* On a reboot, the client machine may overwrite your changes to the `/etc/resolv.conf` file

=== Permanent DNS Integration
For a more permanent solution, here's how to delegate the OpenShift application domain (and if applicable, host domain) from your main DNS service to the OpenShift DNS server. The gist of the work is that you will be telling your main DNS service to _delegate_ to the OpenShift DNS service based on the domain of the name to be looked up.

NOTE: Keep in mind that DNS could be set up in one of a dozen different ways in your organization, so the best we can do is offer guidelines for what you are going to need to do.

DNS services can be thought of as domain containerships. The DNS service that provides lookup information for `example.com` may also contain records for hosts in the subdomain `corp.example.com`. Alternately it may _delegate_ the job of subdomain lookups to another server. Delegation is how you will set the OpenShift DNS service to provide the lookup information for the OpenShift-hosted applications, and possibly also the information for the OpenShift hosts.

==== Step 1. Identify the Point of Delegation
First, you will need to determine the right DNS server or service layer where the delegation should be done. In a simple lab environment this may be pretty obvious, but in a large company this will probably involve the assistance of different members of your IT organization. Unfortunately, this guide can't offer a lot of guidance there. The point is that whatever nameserver is the authority for the _nearest containing subdomain_, that's generally the one where you'll want to define the NS records that refer to your OpenShift nameserver for its domain(s).

==== Step 2. NS Records and A Records
Once you've identified _where_ delegation should occur, you will need to configure the delegation itself. For a typical example, let's say you own `example.com`, and you want to delegate `openshift.example.com` to your OpenShift BIND server:

* The root nameservers delegate "com" to the .com nameservers.
* The .com nameservers delegate "example.com" to your example.com nameservers.
* On your example.com nameserver, you would define a record for the `openshift.example.com` nameserver: +
+
----
openshift.example.com   NS   ns1.openshift.example.com
----
+
And then you would define that name with an IP that points to your OpenShift DNS server: +
+
----
ns1.openshift.example.com  A  10.x.x.x
----

The exact method/syntax for defining will vary by nameserver type, but the outcome should look the same when verified with `dig`.

NOTE: Between you and us, we don't know why you couldn't just put the IP in the NS record and have done, but no one seems to do it that way. Levels of indirection and caching, perhaps?

The OpenShift nameserver can then go on to define subdomains, for instance `hosts.openshift.example.com` and `apps.openshift.example.com`, as it is the master of this (sub)domain.

== Using and Administering Your New OpenShift System
Once your system is up and running, your work with `oo-install` is complete. You cannot use `oo-install` to reconfigure your deployment, though you _can_ use it to add Node hosts to your deployment.

From here, you can learn more about the management and operation of OpenShift from the following guides:
