This guide will walk you through configuring puppet scripts to install and configure OpenShift Origin.

[float]
=== Configuring Puppet for a complex deployment?
OpenShift is, by its nature, a multi-host system. While Puppet works well on a host-by-host basis, synchronizing the deployment of OpenShift across even two hosts requires some extra work that Puppet alone cannot do. If you are interested in a multi-host deployment, be aware that `oo-install` can help you. Using the `oo-install` utility, you can either:

* Have `oo-install` generate your per-host Puppet config files for you _or_
* Automatically perform the whole deployment

So even if you ultimately want to run Puppet by hand, consider using `oo-install` to help you generate your puppet config files. You can learn more about it at https://install.openshift.com[install.openshift.com].

== System Prerequisites
Before you can succesfully run a puppet deployment, you will need to install the `puppet` RPM, and possibly also the `bind` RPM, on your target system. The PuppetLabs site has more information on http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html#for-red-hat-enterprise-linux-and-derivatives[installing puppet from the PuppetLabs repo], and `bind` can be installed using the following command:

----
$ yum install bind -y
----

TIP: The bind installation is only necessary if you want the OpenShift host to act as the nameserver for OpenShift-hosted applications.

=== "Optional" Repository for RHEL
If you are deploying to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, you will also need to enable the Optional repository for some necessary RPMs:

* Via yum config manasger: `yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms`
* Via RHN classic: enable the `rhel-x86_64-server-optional-6` channel

=== Installing the OpenShift Origin Puppet Module
Once puppet has been installed on the target system, you can install the OpenShift Origin module by running this command:

----
$ puppet module install openshift/openshift_origin
----

If you would like to work from the puppet module source instead, you can clone the puppet-openshift_origin repository into the target system as follows:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/puppet-openshift_origin.git /etc/puppet/modules/openshift_origin
----

=== Generating a BIND TSIG Key
If you want OpenShift to manage DNS for hosted applications, you will need to generate a TSIG key for the OpenShift `bind` instance. This key will be used to update DNS records in the BIND server that will be installed,
both for managing application DNS and (by default) for creating host DNS records:

----
#Using example.com as the cloud domain
$ /usr/sbin/dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n USER -r /dev/urandom -K /var/named example.com
$ cat /var/named/Kexample.com.*.key  | awk '{print $8}'
----

The TSIG key should look like `CNk+wjszKi9da9nL/1gkMY7H+GuUng==`. We will use this in the following steps.

=== Update the Hostname
You may also want to change the hostname of the target system before you deploy; here's how.

Choose a hostname and substitute it where needed for "broker.example.com" below.
This sets the host's name locally, not in DNS. For nodes, this is used as the server identity.
Generally it is best to use a name that matches how the host will resolve in DNS.

----
$ cat<<EOF>/etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=broker.example.com
EOF

$ hostname broker.example.com
----

== Puppet Configurations
With Puppet installed, now you can create a file for puppet's installation parameters for this host. This file will define one class (`openshift_origin`) that tells Puppet which OpenShift components to install and configure on the host. If you are new to Puppet, you can learn more about how this works in the http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/parameterized_classes.html[PuppetLabs documentation].

For all of these examples, the indicated configuration is written to a file called `configure_origin.pp`. The the puppet utility is run as follows:

----
puppet apply --verbose configure_origin.pp
----

The deployment process may take up to an hour. After it is completed, refer to the Post-Install Steps below for information on how to finish the OpenShift Origin setup.

=== All-in-One

This configuration will deploy the entire OpenShift system on a single host. This configuration includes an OpenShift-hosted DNS server that handles both the hosted application domain and a separate zone for the OpenShift host.

----

=== Two Hosts: "Basic" Broker and Node

This configuration puts most of the OpenShift components on one host, but configures a second host as a dedicated node. This is a good template for a basic production-capable OpenShift deployment as you can add Node hosts as needed to increase capacity.

}
----

=== Different plugins: Kerberos auth and DNS

This example uses Kerberos for user authentication,
and a Kerberos keytab for making authenticated updates to a remote nameserver.


----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # broker authenticates updates to BIND server with keytab
  broker_dns_plugin          => 'named',
  named_ip_addr              => '<BIND server IP address>',
  bind_krb_principal         => $hostname,
  bind_krb_keytab            => '/etc/dns.keytab'
  register_host_with_named   => true,
  
  # authenticate OpenShift users with kerberos
  broker_auth_plugin         => 'kerberos',
  broker_krb_keytab          => '/etc/http.keytab',
  broker_krb_auth_realms     => 'EXAMPLE.COM',
  broker_krb_service_name    => $hostname,
}
----

Please note:

* The Broker needs to be enrolled in the KDC as a host, `host/node_fqdn` as well as a service, `HTTP/node_fqdn`
* Keytab should be generated, is located on the Broker machine, and Apache should be able to access it (`chown apache <kerberos_keytab>`)
* Like the example config below:
** set `broker_auth_plugin` to `'kerberos'`
** set `broker_krb_keytab` and `bind_krb_keytab` to the absolute file location of the keytab
** set `broker_krb_auth_realms` to the kerberos realm that the Broker host is enrolled with
** set `broker_krb_service_name` to the FQDN of the enrolled kerberos service, e.g. `$hostname`
* After setup, to test:
** authentication: `kinit <user>` then `curl -Ik --negotiate -u : <node_fqdn>`
** GSS-TSIG (should return `nil`):

Use the Rails console on the broker to access the DNS plugin and test that it creates application records.

----
# cd /var/www/openshift/broker
# scl enable ruby193 bash  # (needed for Enterprise Linux only)
# bundle --local
# rails console
# d = OpenShift::DnsService.instance
# d.register_application "appname", "namespace", "node_fqdn"
  => nil
----
For any errors, on the Broker, check `/var/log/openshift/broker/httpd/error_log`.

=== High Availability Deployments
The broker, msgserver and datastore roles can be deployed in high availability (HA) configurations.

==== HA Broker
Broker clustering is accomplished by using HAProxy and a virtual host / IP address as a front for an arbitrary number of Broker instances. This means that you will assign an additional IP address to OpenShift to serve as the virtual IP address and that all OpenShift hosts will use this virtual broker hostname and IP address to communicate with the Broker cluster.

In addition to selecting a virtual broker hostname and IP address, you must elect a Broker host to additionally serve the "load_balancer" role. This Broker will host the HAProxy service that front-ends the cluster.

Here are the variations that you will need to make to your basic configurations:

.Non-Broker host configurations
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Use the *virtual* broker info for these values on hosts that are not Brokers
  broker_hostname => 'virtbroker.openshift.local',
  broker_ip_addr  => '10.10.20.250',

  ...
}
----

.Broker host configurations
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # One and only one of the brokers must include the load_balancer role
  roles => [...,'load_balancer'],

  # Use the actual target host info for these values on hosts that are Brokers
  broker_hostname => <target_hostname>,
  broker_ip_addr  => <target_ip_addr>,

  # Provide the cluster info
  broker_cluster_members      => ['broker1.openshift.local','broker2.openshift.local','broker3.openshift.local'],
  broker_cluster_ip_addresses => ['10.10.20.24','10.10.20.25','10.10.20.26'],
  broker_virtual_hostname     => 'virtbroker.openshift.local',
  broker_virtual_ip_address   => '10.10.20.250',

  # Indicate if this Broker is also the load balancer; if this host includes
  # the load_baancer role, then set this to 'true'
  load_balancer_master => true|false,

  ...
}
----

...And if OpenShift is also handling DNS your you, use this info one the host where you are deploying the 'nameserver' role:

.Nameserver configuration
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Use the *virtual* broker info for these values
  broker_virtual_hostname => 'virtbroker.openshift.local',
  broker_virtual_ip_addr  => '10.10.20.250',

  # Additionally if you are using this nameserver to serve the domain for
  # OpenShift host systems, include the virtual host info in the infrastructure
  # list:
  dns_infrastructure_names =>
  [
   ...
   { hostname => 'virtbroker.openshift.local',
     ipaddr   => '10.10.10.250'
   },
  ],

  ...
}
----

==== HA Datastore
The OpenShift Origin puppet module will configure multiple 'datastore' instances into a MongoDB replica set.

Hosts that will include the Broker role should have this additional information:

.Broker host configuration
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Include the MongoDB replica set information for Brokers
  mongodb_replicasets         => true,
  mongodb_replicasets_members => ['10.10.20.30:27071','10.10.20.31:27071','10.10.20.32:27071'],
}
----

Hosts that include the datastore role should have this information:

.Datastore configuration
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Set the datastore_hostname value to the current datastore host's name
  datastore_hostname => <this_datastore_hostname>,

  # Include the MongoDB replica set information
  mongodb_replicasets         => true,
  mongodb_replicasets_members => ['10.10.20.30:27071','10.10.20.31:27071','10.10.20.32:27071'],

  # One and only of the datastore hosts will be the primary
  mongodb_replica_primary => true|false,

  # All datastore hosts will know the primary's IP address and a
  # common replica key value
  mongodb_replica_primary_ip_addr = <primary_datastore_ip_addr>,
  mongodb_key                     = <replica_key_value>,
}
----

==== HA MsgServer
For message server redundancy, OpenShift makes use of ActiveMQ's native clustering capability.

.MsgServer configuration
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Set the msgserver_hostname to the current msgserver host
  msgserver_hostname => <this_msgserver_hostname>,

  # Set the shared password that the cluster members will use
  msgserver_password => <shared_cluster_password>,

  # Specify the hostnames of all of the cluster members.
  msgserver_cluster         => true,
  msgserver_cluster_members => ['msgserver1.openshift.local','msgserver2.openshift.local','msgserver3.openshift.local'],
}
----

Brokers and Nodes need some of this information even they arent's MsgServer hosts as well:

.Broker and Node configuration
----
class { 'openshift_origin' :
  # Other settings as appropriate per above examples
  ...

  # Specify the hostnames of the msgserver cluster members.
  msgserver_cluster         => true,
  msgserver_cluster_members => ['msgserver1.openshift.local','msgserver2.openshift.local','msgserver3.openshift.local'],
}
----

== Manual Tasks

This script attempts to automate as many tasks as it reasonably can.
Unfortunately, it is constrained to setting up only a single host at a
time. In an assumed multi-host setup, you will need to do the 
following after the script has completed.

1. *Set up DNS entries for hosts.* + 
If you installed BIND with the script, then any other components installed with the script on the same host received DNS entries. Other hosts must all be defined manually, including at least your node hosts. oo-register-dns may prove useful for this.

2. *Copy public rsync key to enable moving gears.* + 
The broker rsync public key needs to go on nodes, but there is no good way to script that generically. Nodes should not have password-less access to brokers to copy the .pub key, so this must be performed manually on each node host: + 
+ 
----
# scp root@broker:/etc/openshift/rsync_id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/
(above step will ask for the root password of the broker machine)
# cat /root/.ssh/rsync_id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# rm /root/.ssh/rsync_id_rsa.pub
----
+ 
If you skip this, each gear move will require typing root passwords for each of the node hosts involved.

3. *Copy ssh host keys between the node hosts.* + 
All node hosts should identify with the same host keys, so that when gears are moved between hosts, ssh and git don't give developers spurious warnings about the host keys changing. So, copy /etc/ssh/ssh_* from one node host to all the rest (or, if using the same image for all hosts, just keep the keys from the image).

4. *Perform the Post-Install tasks.* +
The Comprehensive Deployment guide includes information on the link:oo_deployment_guide_comprehensive.html#post-install-tasks[steps needed to complete a new OpenShift Origin deployment]. These steps incude creating districts and registering gear types, and they are necessary for the proper operation of the system.

== Puppet Parameters

An exhaustive list of the parameters you can specify with puppet configuration follows.

=== roles
Choose from the following roles to be configured on this node.

* broker        - Installs the broker and console.
* node          - Installs the node and cartridges.
* msgserver     - Installs ActiveMQ message broker.
* datastore     - Installs MongoDB (not sharded/replicated)
* nameserver    - Installs a BIND dns server configured with a TSIG key for updates.
* load_balancer - Installs HAProxy and Keepalived for Broker API high-availability.

Default: ["broker","node","msgserver","datastore","nameserver"]

NOTE: Multiple servers are required when using the load_balancer role.

=== install_method
Choose from the following ways to provide packages:

* none - install sources are already set up when the script executes (default)
* yum - set up yum repos manually
** repos_base
** os_repo
** os_updates_repo
** jboss_repo_base
** jenkins_repo_base
** optional_repo

Default: yum

=== parallel_deployment
This flag is used to control some module behaviors when an outside utility
(like oo-install) is managing the deployment of OpenShift across multiple
hosts simultaneously. Some configuration tasks can"t be performed during
a multi-host parallel installation and this boolean enables the user to
indicate whether or not thos tasks should be attempted.

Default: false

=== repos_base
Base path to repository for OpenShift Origin

Nightlies: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/origin-server/nightly/rhel-6 + 
Release (currently v4): https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/origin-server/release/4/rhel-6

Default: Nightlies

=== architecture
CPU Architecture to use for the definition OpenShift Origin yum repositories

Defaults to $::architecture

NOTE: Currently only the `x86_64` architecutre is supported.

=== override_install_repo
Repository path override. Uses dependencies from repos_base but uses
override_install_repo path for OpenShift RPMs. Used when doing local builds.

Default: none

=== os_repo
The URL for a Fedora 19/RHEL 6 yum repository used with the "yum" install method.
Should end in x86_64/os/.

Default: no change

=== os_updates
The URL for a Fedora 19/RHEL 6 yum updates repository used with the "yum" install method.
Should end in x86_64/.

Default: no change

=== jboss_repo_base
The URL for a JBoss repositories used with the "yum" install method.
Does not install repository if not specified.

=== jenkins_repo_base
The URL for a Jenkins repositories used with the "yum" install method.
Does not install repository if not specified.

=== optional_repo
The URL for a EPEL or optional repositories used with the "yum" install method.
Does not install repository if not specified.

=== domain
Default: example.com
The network domain under which apps and hosts will be placed.

=== broker_hostname
=== node_hostname
=== nameserver_hostname
=== msgserver_hostname
=== datastore_hostname
Default: the root plus the domain, e.g. broker.example.com - except
nameserver=ns1.example.com

These supply the FQDN of the hosts containing these components. Used
for configuring the host"s name at install, and also for configuring
the broker application to reach the services needed.

[NOTE]
====
if installing a nameserver, the script will create
DNS entries for the hostnames of the other components being
installed on this host as well. If you are using a nameserver set
up separately, you are responsible for all necessary DNS entries.
====

=== nameserver_ip_addr
IP of a nameserver instance or current IP if installing on this
node. This is used by every node to configure its primary name server.

Default: the current IP (at install)

=== bind_key
When the nameserver is remote, use this to specify the HMAC-MD5 key
for updates. This is the "Key:" field from the .private key file
generated by dnssec-keygen. This field is required on all nodes.

=== bind_krb_keytab
When the nameserver is remote, Kerberos keytab together with principal
can be used instead of the HMAC-MD5 key for updates.

=== bind_krb_principal
When the nameserver is remote, this Kerberos principal together with
Kerberos keytab can be used instead of the HMAC-MD5 key for updates.

=== aws_access_key_id
This and the next value are Amazon AWS security credentials.
The aws_access_key_id is a string which identifies an access credential.

For more info see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#AccessCredentials.

=== aws_secret_key
This is the secret portion of AWS Access Credentials indicated by the
aws_access_key_id

=== aws_zone_id
This is the ID string for an AWS Hosted zone which will contain the
OpenShift application records.

=== node_shmmax
kernel.shmmax sysctl setting for /etc/sysctl.conf

This setting should work for most deployments but if this is desired to be
tuned higher, the general recommendations are as follows:

----
shmmax = shmall * PAGE_SIZE
- PAGE_SIZE = getconf PAGE_SIZE
- shmall = cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
----

shmmax is not recommended to be a value higher than 80% of total available RAM on the system (expressed in BYTES).

Default: kernel.shmmax = 68719476736

=== node_shmall
kernel.shmall sysctl setting for /etc/sysctl.conf, this defaults to 2097152 BYTES

This parameter sets the total amount of shared memory pages that can be
used system wide. Hence, SHMALL should always be at least
ceil(shmmax/PAGE_SIZE).
