This chapter provides information on API resources to add, update, and manage OpenShift user domains. A domain must be created before an OpenShift application can be created. Domain names on OpenShift are non-strict, meaning there is no preceding period, and form part of the application name. Therefore, the syntax for the application name is ApplicationNameâ€“DomainName.DomainSuffix. Each username can only support a single domain, but multiple applications can be created within a domain.

The table below describes each parameter associated with an OpenShift domain.
