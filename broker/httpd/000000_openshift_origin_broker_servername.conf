ServerName localhost

# If node functionality is installed as well,
# /etc/httpd/conf.d/000001_openshift_origin_node_servername.conf
# will override this setting.

# If not, uncomment the following or remove the vhost defined by default in ssl.conf
# to avoid the (harmless) warning:
# [warn] _default_ VirtualHost overlap on port 443, the first has precedence

# NameVirtualHost *:443
