Before enabling this plug-in, you need to add a new user, topic, and
queue to ActiveMQ.  Edit /etc/activemq/activemq.xml and add the
following user:

<authenticationUser username="routinginfo" password="routinginfopasswd" groups="routinginfo,everyone"/>

Then add the following authorization entries:

<authorizationEntry topic="routinginfo.>" write="routinginfo" read="routinginfo" admin="routinginfo" />
<authorizationEntry queue="routinginfo.>" write="routinginfo" read="routinginfo" admin="routinginfo" />

To enable the plug-in, copy the file
/etc/openshift/plugins.d/routing-activemq.conf.example to
/etc/openshift/plugins.d/routing-activemq.conf on your broker and edit
the settings therein appropriately to point to your ActiveMQ server and
to use the topic and credentials you have configured for ActiveMQ.
