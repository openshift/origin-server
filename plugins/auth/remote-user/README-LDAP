#You can setup an ldap server by doing the following:

#install openldap
yum install openldap*

#stop the ldap service if it's running
service slapd stop

#import the user ldiff
slapadd -l ldap-user-sample.ldiff

#change the ownership of /var/lib/ldap
chown -R ldap.ldap /var/lib/ldap

#start the ldap service
service slapd start


#Now that the ldap service is running, rename the sample httpd configuration file:
mv openshift-origin-auth-remote-user-ldap.sample openshift-origin-auth-remote-user-ldap.conf

#Change the AuthLDAPURL hostname to reflect the actual hostname or IP address of your ldap server
#Restart the OpenShift Broker

service openshift-broker restart
