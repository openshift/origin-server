Public, static content goes here.  Users can create rewrite rules to link to
content in the static dir.  For example, django commonly uses /media/
directories for static content.  For example in a .htaccess file in a
wsgi/.htaccess location, developers could put:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/media/(.+)$ /static/media/$1 [L]

Then copy the media/* content to yourapp/wsgi/static/media/ and it should
just work.

Note: The ^application/ part of the URI match is required.
