#  This file contains a list of Node modules and optionally version
#  (one per line) of the form: <module-name>@<version>
#  to install alongside your app ("locally") on the OpenShift environment.
#

#  Any blank lines or lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored.
#  E.g. uncomment the next line to install sqlite3
#sqlite3

#
#  For a list of globally installed modules - see file: npm_global_module_list.
#
#  Note: You can override a globally available module by specifying it in this
#        file or packaging it in the node_modules/ directory. Node will give
#        preference to the "locally" installed version of that module.
