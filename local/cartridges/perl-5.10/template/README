Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
perl/ - Externally exposed perl code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed perl code
../data - For persistent data (Also in env var OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR)
deplist.txt - A list of perl modules required to run
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift Express provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME'}  - Application name
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR'}   - Application dir
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR'}  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR'}   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc app cartridge add', you can reference environment
variables for username, host and password:

    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST'}      - DB host
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DB_PORT'}      - DB Port
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DB_USERNAME'}  - DB Username
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD'}  - DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave perl, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


deplist.txt
===========

Adding module names to deplist.txt causes your remote OpenShift node to download
the required modules and install them.


Additional information
======================

Link to additional information will be here, when we have it :)
