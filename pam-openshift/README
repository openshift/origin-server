pam_openshift — PAM module to set the default security context

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

In a nutshell, pam_openshift sets up the default security context for the next
execed shell.

When an application opens a session using pam_openshift, the shell that gets
executed will be run in the default security context.

Adding pam_openshift into a pam file could cause other pam modules to change
their behavior if the exec another application. The close and open option help
mitigate this problem. close option will only cause the close portion of the
pam_openshift to execute, and open will only cause the open portion to run. You
can add pam_openshift to the config file twice. Add the pam_openshift close as the
executes the open pass through the modules, pam_openshift open_session will
happen last. When PAM executes the close pass through the modules pam_openshift
close_session will happen first.
