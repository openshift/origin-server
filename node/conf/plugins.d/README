To enable a plug-in, merely create a file in this directory named as the
name of the plug-in with ".conf" appended.  For example, to enable the
DNS BIND plug-in, create the following file:

   /etc/openshift/plugins.d/openshift-origin-dns-bind.conf

The broker will then load the plug-in and read in the settings for the
plug-in from openshift-origin-dns-bind.conf.

In most cases, the RPM packages for a given plug-in will drop a default
configuration file into this directory, so the plug-in will be enabled
automatically when it is installed.
