# Uncomment the following line if you want to enable the Watchman Metrics plugin.
# This plugin will gather and publish the following metrics for all gears:
#
# - cgroups information
#
# - cartridge metrics, if a cartridge's manifest.yml contains a Metrics entry
#   and it contains an executable bin/metrics script
#
# - application metrics, if the application repository contains an executable
#   .openshift/action_hooks/metrics script
#
# This plugin is *disabled* by default and can only be enabled by uncommenting
# the line below.
#
# WATCHMAN_METRICS_ENABLED=true


# Specify how often (in seconds) the Watchman Metrics plugin should gather metrics.
# Default value: 60 seconds
#
# WATCHMAN_METRICS_INTERVAL=30


# Specify the names and display order of metadata about a gear that are
# included in each message.
#
# This value must have the format $keyName1:$metadata1,$keyName2:$metadata2,...
#
# Each key is user-specified (e.g. app_name or appName or app).
#
# Each metadata item is a gear environment variable such as
# OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME, OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID, etc.
#
# The default value is "appName:OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME,gear:OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID,app:OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID,ns:OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE"
#
# METRICS_METADATA="appName:OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME,gearUuid:OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID"


# Specify which cgroups keys to retrieve when gathering cgroups metrics.
#
# If not set, defaults to all available cgroups keys.
#
# Note: only specify the name of the key and not the value(s) within it.
# For example, if you want to get information from memory.stat (such as
# memory.stat's rss), you must specify memory.stat. This will retrieve
# all the values associated with memory.stat and report them all. There is
# currently no support for specifying something such as memory.stat.rss
# and having it only report on that single value.
#
# CGROUPS_METRICS_KEYS="cpu.stat,cpuacct.stat,memory.usage_in_bytes"


# Specify the maximum length of a cgroups metrics message (not including
# other fields that Syslog may include, such as timestamp and pid).
#
# Default value is 1024 bytes.
#
# Syslog messages have a maximum length, typically around 2048 bytes.
# As such, this value should be low enough to ensure that additional
# Syslog fields such as timestamp, pid, app uuid, gear uuid, and so on
# can fit without anything being truncated.
#
# This will allow multiple cgroups metrics to be batched together in a
# single line, which is more efficient resource-wise than if each metric
# were printed on its own line.
#
# This is the maximum length of a cgroups metrics message, but it is possible
# that some messages may be shorter.
#
# MAX_CGROUPS_METRICS_MESSAGE_LENGTH=1024


# Maximum amount of time (in seconds) a gear's cartridge and application
# metrics may execute before being terminated. This timeout applies
# to the overall execution of *all* of a gear's cartridge and application
# metrics scripts.
#
# Defaults to 3 seconds.
#
# METRICS_PER_GEAR_TIMEOUT=3


# Maximum amount of time (in seconds) that an individual cartridge or
# application metrics script my execute before being terminated.
#
# Defaults to 1 second.
#
# METRICS_PER_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT=1


# Maximum line length allowed for metrics coming from cartridge and
# applciation metrics scripts. Lines over this length will be discarded
# in their entirety.
#
# Defaults to 2000 bytes.
#
# METRICS_MAX_LINE_LENGTH=2000

# Each Gear has its own dedicated loopback IP address range that is determined
# by its UID.  Valid UIDs are in the range of 0-2^32 however there are only
# 65535 * 2 loopback IP address ranges available for OpenShift Gears.  This is
# never a problem because a single district will never exhaust this many
# loopback IPs.
#
# However, in environments where high numbered UIDs are required it's important
# 127.0.0.1 is never given to a gear that "wraps around". To avoid this
# situation an offset is configured.  By default any UID greater than or equal
# to WRAPAROUND_UID will offset by IP_ADDRESS_WRAPAROUND_OFFSET and then
# shifted left 7 bits.  For example, setting IP_ADDRESS_WRAPAROUND_OFFSET=1
# will cause the wrap around IP addresses to start at 127.0.0.128.  The left
# shifting by 7 is important because each Gear has an IP address range of 127
# IPs (127.x.x.0 and 127.x.x.128 are unused).  These settings must be the same
# for all Nodes in a district and must not be changed for any Node with running
# Gears.
#
# WRAPAROUND_UID is also used for Traffic Control where OpenShift manages a
# maximum of 65535 queuing disciplines.  Again, this is never a problem in a
# District however we need the queuing disciplines to wrap around.
#
# Defaults:
#
# WRAPAROUND_UID=65536
# IP_ADDRESS_WRAPAROUND_OFFSET=1

# Enable archiving gears on gear destroy due to failure during
# app-create; requires ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS_DIR to be set
# appropriately
#
# Defaults:
#
# ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS="false"

# Directory for storing gear directory archives (see:
# ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS). The archive directory must meet these
# conditions:
#
# * must be writable by the ruby193-mcollective service user (root)
# * must not be world-readable
# * must not be world-writable
#
# For example, a suitable directory can be created by setting the node
# option:
#
# ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS_DIR="/cartout"
#
# ... and running the following as root:
#
# mkdir /cartout ; chmod 750 /cartout
#
# Defaults:
#
# ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS_DIR=

# Compression to use for gear directory archives. Valid options
# include "bzip2", "gzip", or "none".
#
# "bzip2" yields the best compression ratio, but tends to be
# significantly slower than gzip. This should be used when the disk
# space available in ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS_DIR is the primary
# resource constraint.
#
# "gzip" typically generates larger archives than bzip2, but is
# consistently between 2 to 10 times faster than bzip2.
#
# "none" is little more than a filesystem copy, and applies no
# compression to generated archives. It is the fastest of the three
# options, and is useful when time is the primary resource constraint.
#
# Defaults:
#
# ARCHIVE_DESTROYED_GEARS_COMPRESSION="bzip2"

# Have oo-trap-user write an entry to syslog when a gear user logs in.
# Leave 'true' to enable this, comment out or change to disable it.
