# How To Write An OpenShift Origin Cartridge 2.0

OpenShift cartridges provide the necessary command and control for
the functionality of software that is running user's applications.
OpenShift currently has many language cartridges JBoss, PHP, Ruby
(Rails) etc. as well as many DB cartridges such as Postgres, Mysql,
Mongo etc. Before writing your own cartridge you should search the
current list of [Red Hat](https://openshift.redhat.com) and [OpenShift
Community](https://openshift.redhat.com/community) provided cartridges.

Cartridge configuration and setup is convention based, with an emphasis
on minimizing external dependencies in your cartridge code.

## Cartridge Directory Structure

This is an example structure to which your cartridge is expected to
conform when written to disk. Failure to meet these expectations will
cause your cartridge to not function when either installed or used on
OpenShift. You may have additional directories or files as required to meet
the needs of the software you are packaging and the application developers
using your cartridge.

    `cartridge name`-`cartridge version`
     +- bin                        (required)
     |  +- setup                   (required)
     |  +- teardown                (optional)
     |  +- control                 (required)
     |- hooks                      (optional)
     |  +- set-db-connection-info  (discretionary)
     +- versions                   (discretionary)
     |  +- `software version`
     |  |  +- bin
     |  |     +- ...
     |  |  +- data
     |  |     +- template          (optional)
     |  |        +- .openshift
     |  |        |   +- ...
     |  |        +- ... (directory/file tree)
     |  |     +- template.git       (discretionary)
     |  |        +- ... (git bare repo)
     |  +- ...
     +- env                        (required)
     |  +- *.erb
     +- template                   (optional)
     |  +- ... (directory/file tree)
     +  template.git               (discretionary)
     +  +- ... (bare git repository)
     +- usr                        (optional)
     |  +- ...
     +- metadata                   (required)
     |  +- manifest.yml            (required)

     |  +- snapshot_exclusions.txt (optional)
     |  +- snapshot_transforms.txt (optional)
     +- conf.d                     (discretionary)
     |  +- openshift.conf.erb
     +- conf                       (discretionary)
     |  +- magic

Items marked:
  * `required` must exist for minimal OpenShift support of your cartridge
  * `optional` exist to support additional functionality
  * `discretionary` should be considered best practices for your cartridge and work. E.g.,
    `conf.d` is the usual name for where a web framework would install it's `httpd` configuration.


To support multiple software versions within one cartridge,
you may create symlinks between the bin/control and the setup
versions/{cartridge version}/bin/control file. Or, you may choose
to use the bin/control file as a shim to call the correct versioned
control file.

When creating an instance of your cartridge for use by a gear, OpenShift
will copy the files, links and directories from the cartridge library
with the exclusion of the `usr` directory. The `usr` directory will be
sym-linked into the gear's cartridge instance. This allows for sharing
of libraries and other data across all cartridge instances.

Later (see Cartridge Locking) we'll describe how, as the cartridge author,
you can customize a cartridge instance.

## Cartridge Metadata

The `manifest.yml` file is used by OpenShift to determine what features
your cartridge requires and in turn publishes. OpenShift also uses fields
in the `manifest.yml` to determine what data to present to the cartridge
user about your cartridge.

An example `manifest.yml` file:

```yaml
Name: PHP
CartridgeShortName: PHP
CartridgeVersion: 1.0.1
CartridgeVersions: [1.0.1]

```

### CartridgeShortName Element

OpenShift creates a number of environment variables for you, when installing your cartridge.
This shorten name is used when creating those variables.
For example, using the example manifest the following environment variables would be created:

    OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR
    OPENSHIFT_PHP_IP
    OPENSHIFT_PHP_PORT
    OPENSHIFT_PHP_PROXY_PORT


### CartridgeVersion Element

The `CartridgeVersion` element is a version number identifying a release of your cartridge to OpenShift.
The value follows the format:

    <number>[.<number>[.<number>[...]]]

When you publish new versions of your cartridge to OpenShift, this number will be used to determine what
is necessary to upgrade the application developer's application.

### CartridgeVersions Element

`CartridgeVersions` is a list of past cartridge versions that are **compatible** with this version.
To be **compatible** with a previous version, the code changes you made in this version do not require
the cartridge to be re-started or the application developer's application to be restarted.

    CartridgeVersions: [1.0.1]

By not requiring a restart, you improve the application user's experience since no downtime will
be incurred from your changes. If the cartridge's current version is not in the list when upgraded,
the cartridge will be stopped, the new code will be installed, `setup` will be run, and the cartridge
started.

Today this is a simple list and string matching is used to determine compatible versions.
If this list proves to be unmanageable, future versions of OpenShift may implement maven dependency range style checking.

### Version Element

The `Version` element is the default or only version of the software packaged by this cartridge.

    Version: 5.3

### Versions Element

`Versions` is the list of the versions of the software packaged by this cartridge.
    Versions: [5.3]

### Endpoints Element
See below.

*jwh: How do we want to cover the other manifest.yml features?*

## Cartridge Locking

Cartridge instances within a gear will be either `locked` or `unlocked`
at any given time. Locking a cartridge allows the cartridge scripts
to have additional access to the gear's files and directories. Other
scripts and hooks written by the application developer will not be able to
override decisions you make as the cartridge author.

The lock state is controlled by OpenShift. Cartridges are locked and
unlocked at various points in the cartridge lifecycle.

If you fail to provide a `metadata/locked_files.txt` file or the file
is empty, your cartridge will remain always unlocked. For a very simple cartridges
this may be sufficient.

**Note on security:** Cartridge file locking is not intended to be a
security measure. It is a mechanism to help prevent application developers
from inadvertently breaking their application by modifying files reserved
for use by you, the cartridge author.

### Lock configuration ###

The `metadata/locked_files.txt` lists the files and directories, one
per line, that will be provided to the cartridge author with read/write
access while the cartridge is unlocked, but only read access to the
application developer while the cartridge is locked.

Any non-existent files that are included in the list will be created
before your `setup` script is called.  Any missing parent directories will be
created as needed. The list is anchored at the gear's home directory.
An entry ending in slash is processed as a directory.  Entries ending
in asterisk are a list of files.  Entries ending in an other character
are considered files.  OpenShift will not attempt to change files to
directories or vice versa, and your cartridge may fail to operate if
files are miscatergorized and you depend on OpenShift to create them.

#### Lock configuration example

Here is a `locked_files.txt` for a PHP cartridge:

    .pearrc
    php-5.3/bin/
    php-5.3/conf/*

In the above list:
  * the file `.pearrc` will be created, if it does not exists, and be made editable by you.
  * the directory `php-5.3/bin` is locked but not the files it contains. While you can add files, both you
    and the application developer can edit any files contained.
  * the files in `php-5.3/conf` are locked but the directory itself is not.
    So you or the application developer can add files, but only you can edit them.

Directories like `.node-gyp` and `.npm` in nodejs are **NOT** candidates
to be created in this manner as they require the application developer to have read
and write access while the application is deploying and running. These
directories would need to be created by the nodejs `setup` script.

The following list is reserved by OpenShift in the the gear's home
directory:

    .ssh
    .sandbox
    .tmp
    .env
    any not hidden directory or file

You may create any hidden file or directory (one that starts with a
period) not in the reserved list in the gear's home directory while the
cartridge is unlocked.

## template vs template.git (for language cartridges)

`template` or `template.git` directory should provide an minimal example of an application
written in the language/framework your cartridge is packaging.
Your application should welcome the application developer to
your cartridge and let them see that your cartridge has indeed been installed and operating.
If you provide a `template` directory, OpenShift will transform it into a bare git repository
for use by the application developer. If you provide a `template.git` directory, OpenShift will
copy the directory for use by the application developer. Your `setup` script should assume that
`template` directories may be converted to `template.git` during the packaging of your cartridge
for use by OpenShift. The PaaS operator may choose to convert all `template` directories to bare
git repositories `template.git` to obtain the performance gain when adding your cartridge to gear.
One good workflow point to make this change is when your cartridge is packaged into an RPM.

A `ruby 1.8` with `Passenger` support would have a `public` sub-directory and
a `config.ru` file to define the web application.

    +- template
    |  +- config.ru
    |  +- public
    |  |  +- .gitignore
    |  .openshift
    |  +- markers
    |  |- ...

Note that .gitignore should be placed in empty directories to ensure they survive when the file tree
is loaded into a git repository.

### Application Developer Action Hooks

The sub-directory `.openshift/markers` may contain example files for the application developer.
These files denote behaviour you are expected to honor in your cartridges lifecycle. Current
examples from a Ruby 1.8 cartridge include:

    force_clean_build     Previous output from bundle install --deployment will be
                          removed and all gems will be reinstalled according to the
                          current Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.
    hot_deploy            Will prevent the apache process from being restarted during
                          build/deployment. Note that mod_passenger will respawn the
                          Rack worker processes if any code has been modified.
    disable_auto_scaling  Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up
                          or down according to application load.

You may add additional markers to allow an application developer to control aspects
of your cartridge.

The sub-directory `.openshift/action_hooks` will contain code the application developer
wishes run during lifecycle changes. Examples would be:

    pre_start_`cartridge name`-`software version`
    post_start_`cartridge name`-`software version`
    pre_stop_`cartridge name`-`software version`
    ...

You can obtain a template for the `template` directory from [xxx](http;//git...yyy).
You will want to down the repo as a zip file and extract the files into your
cartridge's `template` directory. Further details are in the README.writing_applications.md
document.

As a cartridge author you do not need to execute the default `action_hooks`.
OpenShift will call them during lifecycle changes based on the actions given to the
`control` script. If you wish to add additional hooks, you are expected to document them
and you will need to run them explicitly in your `control` script.

## Exposing Services / TCP Endpoints

Most cartridges provide a service by binding to one or many ports. Cartridges
must explicitly declare which ports they will bind to, and provide meaningful
variable names to describe:

  * Any IP addresses necessary for binding
  * The gear-local ports to which the cartridge services will bind
  * (Optional) Publicly proxied ports which expose gear-local ports for use by the
    application's users or across application gears

These declarations represent "Endpoints," and are defined in the cartridge
`manifest.yml` in the `Endpoints` section using the following syntax:

```
Endpoints:
  - "<name of IP variable>:<name of port variable>(<port>)[:<name of public port variable>]"
  - ...
```

During cartridge installation within a gear, IP addresses will be automatically
allocated and assigned to each distinct IP variable name, with the guarantee
that the specified port will be bindable on the allocated address.

If an endpoint specifies a public port variable, a public port proxy mapping will
be created using a random external port accessible via the gear's DNS entry.

Each portion of the endpoint definition becomes available via environment variables
located within the gear and accessible to cartridge scripts and application code. The
names of these variables are prefixed with OpenShift namespacing information in the
follow the format:

```
OPENSHIFT_{CartridgeShortName}_{name of IP variable} => <assigned internal IP>
OPENSHIFT_{CartridgeShortName}_{name of port variable} => <endpoint specified port>
OPENSHIFT_{CartridgeShortName}_{name of public port variable} => <assigned external port>
```

`CartridgeShortName` is the `CartridgeShortName` element from the cartridge manifest file. See above.

### Endpoint Example

Given a cartridge named `CustomCart` and the following entry in `manifest.yml`:

```
Name: CustomCart
CartridgeShortName: CUSTOMCART

...

Endpoints:
  - "HTTP_IP:WEB_PORT(8080):WEB_PROXY_PORT"
  - "HTTP_IP:ADMIN_PORT(9000):ADMIN_PROXY_PORT"
  - "INTERNAL_SERVICE_IP:INTERNAL_SERVICE_PORT(5544)"
```

The following environment variables will be generated:

```
# Internal IP/port allocations
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP=<assigned internal IP 1>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PORT=8080
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PORT=9000
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_INTERNAL_SERVICE_IP=<assigned internal IP 2>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_INTERNAL_SERVICE_PORT=5544

# Public proxy port mappings
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PROXY_PORT=<assigned public port 1>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PROXY_PORT=<assigned public port 2>
```

In the above example, the public proxy port mappings are as follows:

```
<assigned external IP>:<assigned public port 1> => OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PORT
<assigned external IP>:<assigned public port 2> => OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PORT
```


## Cartridge Scripts

How you implement the cartridge scripts in the `bin` directory is
up to you as the author. For easily configured software where your
cartridge is just installing one version, these scripts may include all
the necessary code. For complex configurations or multi-version support,
you may choose to write these scripts as shim code to setup the necessary
environment before calling additional scripts you write. Or, you may
choose to create symlinks from these names to a name of your choosing.
Your API is the scripts and their associated actions. The scripts will
be run from the home directory of the gear.

A cartridge must implement the following scripts:

* `setup`: prepare this instance of cartridge to be operational
* `control`: command cartridge to report or change state

A cartridge may implement the following scripts:
* `teardown`: prepare this instance of cartridge to be removed

### Exit Status Codes

OpenShift follows the convention that your scripts should return zero
for success, and non-zero success. Additionally, OpenShift follows the
conventions from sysexit.h below:

```
    0. Success
   64. Usage: The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
   65. Data Error: The input data was incorrect in some way.  This should only be used for user's data and not system files.
   66. No Input: An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable.  This could also include errors like "No message" to a mailer.
   67. No User: The user specified did not exist.  This might be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
   68. No Host: The host specified did not exist.  This is used in mail addresses or network requests.
   69. A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a support program or file does not exist.
       This can also be used as a catchall message when something you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.
   70. Software Error: An internal software error has been detected.  This should be limited to non-operating system related errors as possible.
   71. OS Error: An operating system error has been detected.  This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot fork",
       "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes things like getuid returning a user that does not exist in the passwd file.
   72. OS File: Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/utmp, etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
   73. Cannot Create: A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
   74. IO Error: An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
   75. Temporary Failure: Failure is something that is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
        and the request should be reattempted later.
   76. Protocol: the remote system returned something that was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
   77. No Permission: You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation.  This is not intended for file system problems,
       which should use NOINPUT or CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
   78. Configuration Error: A fatal configuration problem was found, but this does not necessarily mean that
       the problem was found while reading the configuration file.
   80-128. reserved for OpenShift usage
   128 + n. Where N is the signal that killed your script

Copyright (c) 1987, 1993 The Regents of the University of California.  All rights reserved.
```

These exit status codes will allow OpenShift to refine it's behavior
when returning HTTP status codes for the REST API, whether an internal
operation can continue or should aborted etc. Should your script return
a value not included in this table, OpenShift will assume the problem
is fatal to your cartridge.

## bin/setup

##### Synopsis

`setup [--version=<version>]`

##### Options

* `--version=<version>`: Selects which version of cartridge to install. If no version is provided,
the version denoted by the `Version` element from `manifest.yml` will be installed.

##### Description

The `setup` script is responsible for creating and/or configuring the
files that were copied from the cartridge repository into the gear's
directory.

If you have used ERB templates for software configuration those files will be
processed for environment variable substitution after `setup` is run.  An
example would be PHP's php.ini file:

    upload_tmp_dir = "<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] %>php-5.3/tmp/"
    session.save_path = "<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] %>php-5.3/sessions/"

Other candidates for templates are httpd configuration files for
`includes`, configuring database to store persistent data in the
OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR, and setting the application name in the pom.xml file.

`setup` may substitute a version dependent of the `template` or `template.git` directories.

Lock context: `unlocked`

##### Messaging to OpenShift from cartridge

Your cartridge may provide a service or services that is consumed by
multiple gears in one application. OpenShift provides the orchestration
necessary for you to publish this service or services. Each message is
written to stdout, one message per line.

* `ENV_VAR_ADD: <variable name>=<value>`
* `CART_DATA: <variable name>=<value>`
* `CART_PROPERTIES: <key>=<value>`
* `APP_INFO: <value>`

*jwh: need to explain when/where to use each...  May need to change format to match Lock context*
*jwh: See Krishna when he is back in town. He wished to make changes in this area with the model refactor.*

## Custom HTTP Services

Your cartridge may expose services using the application's URL by
providing snippet(s) of Apache configuration code using ERB templates
in the httpd.d directory. The httpd.d directory and it's contents are
optional.  After OpenShift has run your `setup` script it will render
each ERB template, and write the contents the node's httpd configuration.

An example of `mongodb-2.2.conf.erb`:

    Alias /health <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb-2.2/httpd.d/health.html" %>
    Alias / <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb-2.2/httpd.d/index.html" %>

Your templates will be rendered at `safe_level 2`.  [Locking Ruby in
the Safe](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/taint.html).

## bin/teardown

##### Synopsis

`teardown`

##### Description

The `teardown` script prepares the gear for the cartridge to be
removed. This script will not called when the gear is destroyed.  The `teardown`
script is only run when a cartridge is to be removed from the gear.
The gear is expected to continue to operate minus the functionality of your cartridge
cartridge.

Lock context: `unlocked`

*jwh: If all future gears are scaled, should teardown just always be called?*

##### Messaging to OpenShift from cartridge

After `teardown` your cartridge's services are no longer available. For
each environment variable you published, you must now un-publish it by
writing to stdout the following message(s):

* `ENV_VAR_REMOVE: <name>`

*jwh: See Krishna when he is back in town. He wished to make changes in this area with the model refactor.*

## bin/control

##### Synopsis

`control <action>`

##### Options

* `action`: which operation the cartridge should perform.

##### Description

The `control` script allows OpenShift or user to control the state of the cartridge.

The list of operations your cartridge may be called to perform:

   * `build` is called when building the developers application and by default
     from the git respository post-receive hook. The application is built in `app-root/runtime/repo`.
   * `deploy` is called to activate the developer's application in `app-root/runtime/repo` usually
     after a successful `build`
   * `start` start the software your cartridge controls
   * `stop` stop the software your cartridge controls
   * `status` return an 0 exit status if your cartridge code is running.
   * `reload` your cartridge and the packaged software needs to re-read their
      configuration information. Depending on the features of the software your
      cartridge has packaged this may equate to a restart.
   * `restart` stop current process and start a new one for the code your cartridge packages
   * `threaddump` if applicable, your cartridge should signal the packaged software to perform a thread dump.
     An exit status of `69` signals OpenShift that your cartridge or packaged software does not support this
     operation.
   * `tidy` all unused resources should be released. It is at your discretion to
      determine what should be done. Be frugal, on some systems resources may be
      very limited. Some possible behaviors:
```
    rm .../logs/log.[0-9]
    mvn clean
```
     OpenShift has the following default behaviors:
        * the git repository will be garbage collected
        * all files will be removed from the /tmp directory

Lock context: `locked`

###### `status` Action

For a number of reasons the application developer will want to be a
to query whether the software your cartridge packages is running and
behaving as expected.  A `0` exit status implies that the software is
running correctly. 

You may direct information to the application developer by writing
to stdout.  Errors may be return on stderr with an non-zero exit status.

OpenShift maintains the expected state of the gear/application in
`~/app-root/runtime/.state`. You may not use this to determine the
status of the software you are packaging.  That software may have
crashed so you would be returning invalid status if you used this file's
value. Future versions of OpenShift may combine the results from the
`status` action and the value of the `.state` file to automatically
restart failed applications. For completeness, `.state` values:

    * `building`    application is currently being built
    * `deploying`   application is currently being deployed
    * `idle`        application has been shutdown because of no activity
    * `new`         gear has been created, but no application has been installed
    * `started`     application has been commanded to start
    * `stopped`     application has been commanded to stop

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are use to communicate information between
this cartridge and others, and to OpenShift.  The cartridge controlled
variables are stored in the env directory and will be loaded after
system provided environment variables but before your code is called.
OpenShift provided environment variables will be loaded and available
to be used for all cartridge entry points.

### System Provided Variables (Read Only) ###
 * `HOME`                alias for `OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR`
 * `HISTFILE`            bash history file
 * `OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS`   the application's fully qualified domain name that your cartridge is a part of
 * `OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME`  the validated user assigned name for the application. Black list is system dependent.
 * `OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID`  OpenShift assigned UUID for the application
 * `OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR`  the directory where your cartridge may store data
 * `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DNS`  the gear's fully qualified domain name that your cartridge is a part of. May or may
                         not be equal to `OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS`
 * `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME` OpenShift assigned name for the gear. May or may not be equal to `OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME`
 * `OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID` OpenShift assigned UUID for the gear
 * `OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR`   OpenShift assigned directory for the gear
 * `OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR`  the directory where the developer's application is "archived" to and will be run from.
 * `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR`   the directory where your cartridge may store temporary data
 * `TMPDIR`              alias for `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR`
 * `TMP`                 alias for `OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR`

### Examples of Cartridge Variables  ###

These are variables you either provided to you for communicating to the application developer.  You may add
additional variables for your cartridges or the packaged software needs. You may provide these files in your
cartridge's `env` directory or choose to create them in your `setup` script.

 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST`                  Backwards compatibility (ERB populate from `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_IP`)
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_IP`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_LOG_DIR`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_SOCKET`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL`
 * `OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME`
 * `OPENSHIFT_PHP_LOG_DIR`
 * `OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR`

Some variable may be dictated by the software you are packaging:

 * `JENKINS_URL`
 * `JENKINS_USERNAME`
 * `JENKINS_PASSWORD`

Your environment variables should be prefixed with
`OPENSHIFT_{cartridge short name}_` to prevent overwriting other cartridge
variables in the packaged software's process environment space.

By convention, an environment variable who's value is a directory should have a
name that ends in `_DIR` and the value should have a trailing slash.
The software you are packaging may have environment variable requirements of it's own,
for example: `JENKINS_URL`.
Those you would add to your `env` directory or include in shim code in your `bin` scripts.

Cartridge provided environment variables are not validated by the
system. Your cartridge may fail to function if you write invalid data
to these files. If you provide ERB templates in the `env` directory,
OpenShift will render those files and remove the .erb suffix. They will
be processed before your `setup` script is run. You could write the
`env/JENKINS_URL.erb` as:

    export JENKINS_URL='https://<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS'] %>/'

which would then be rendered as `env/JENKINS_URL`:

    export JENKINS_URL='http://jenkins-namespace.rhcloud.com/'

Or, `env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR.erb`:

    export OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR='<% ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb-2.2/log/" %>'

renders as `env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR`:

    export OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR='/var/lib/openshift/aa9e0f66e6451791f86904eef0939e/mongodb-2.2/log/'

Your templates will be rendered at `safe_level 2`.  [Locking Ruby in
the Safe](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/taint.html).

You may assume the PATH variable will be:
     PATH=/bin:/usr/bin/

when your code is executed. Any additional directories your code requires
will need to be added in your cartridge's `env` variable.

## Backing up and Restoring your cartridge

OpenShift uses the tar command when backing up and restoring the gear that
contains your cartridge. The file `metadata/snapshot_exclusions.txt`
contains a pattern per line of files that will not be backed up or
restored. If you exclude files from being backed up and restored you need
to ensure those files are not required for your cartridge's operation.

The file `metadata/snapshot_transforms.txt` contains sed replace
expressions one per line and is used to transform file names during
restore.

Both files are optional and may be omitted. Empty files will be
ignored. Patterns are from the OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR parent directory rather
than your cartridge's directory.  See the man page for tar the --transform
and --exclude-from for more details.

The following files and directories are never backed up:

```
.tmp
.ssh
.sandbox
*/conf.d/openshift.conf
*/run/httpd.pid
haproxy-\*/run/stats
app-root/runtime/.state
app-root/data/.bash_history
```

## Sample `conf.d/openshift.conf.erb`

```

DocumentRoot "<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] + "/public" %>"

## Cartridge publish/subscribe mechanism

Cartridges may need to act when some other cartridge is added/removed from an application.
This functionality is supported using Publish/Subscribe connectors in the manifest.yml.

Consider a simple example of a php cartridge that wants to know when mysql is added to
an application, so that it can set environment variables on the gear to be able to connect
to the newly added mysql cartridge on a different gear.

This requires a Subscribes section in the PHP cartridge manifest.yml:
```
Subscribes:
  set-mysql-connection-info:
    Type: "NET_TCP:db:mysql"
```

And a Publishes section in the MySQL cartridge manifest.yml
```
Publishes:
  publish-mysql-connection-info:
    Type: "NET_TCP:db:mysql"
```

Now, to make this work, we add a hook file named set-mysql-connection-info to php
cartridge and a hook called publish-mysql-connection-info to mysql cartridge.

These hook files must be created under the hooks directory in cartridge directory structure.

These two hooks are matched up on the basis of the string value in Type i.e. "NET_TCP:db:mysql"

The hook publish-mysql-connection-info could output host, port, password to connect to mysql
and it will be fed as input to the set-mysql-connection-info php hook when MySQL is
added to an application that has PHP installed.

The PHP hook could choose to write out the connection variables in the environment so that
application could use the variables to be able to connect to the MySQL server.
