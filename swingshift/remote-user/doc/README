                    Remote User Auth Plugin for OpenShift
                   ----------------------------------
The Remote User Auth plugin is an optional plugin for OpenShift and it provides
authentication.  Authentication is delegated to a web server.  The Ruby code
trusts the REMOTE_USER environment variable.  This plugin also handles
node->broker authentication through the use of an encrypted key.

This document describes how to register and authenticate an OpenShift user
using the Remote User Auth plugin.  This example will use Basic Authentication.

* Create the htpassd file:

    # Substitute the username as needed
    htpasswd -c /etc/stickshift/htpasswd user1

* Create an Apache configuration.  A sample is provided:
    mv /var/www/stickshift/broker/httpd/conf.d/openshift-origin-auth-remote-user.conf{.sample,}

* Create the broker key
    /usr/bin/openssl genrsa -out /etc/stickshift/server_priv.pem 2048
    /usr/bin/openssl rsa -in /etc/stickshift/server_priv.pem -pubout > /etc/stickshift/server_pub.pem

* Edit the configuration in /etc/stickshift/plugins.d/openshift-origin-auth-remote-user.conf.
  NOTE: See current issues.  This step can be skipped for now.

  Set the salt to something only you know.

* Edit /var/www/stickshift/broker/Gemfile to add the plugin:

  gem 'openshift-origin-auth-remote-user'

  NOTE: Be sure to remote any other authentication plugins.  You may need to
  remote plugin references from
  /var/www/stickshift/broker/config/environments/development.rb as well.

* From /var/www/stickshift/broker/ run 'bundle install --local'

* Restart the stickshift-broker service
    service stickshift-broker restart

* Authenticate StickShift user
  Any REST api calls or CLI tools to StickShift will be processed only for the registered user-name/password
  Example:
    The below query fails with 'Access Denied' error.
    curl -k https://localhost/broker/rest/domains

    The below query succeeds for valid username/password.
    curl -k --user "<registered-user-name>:<password>" https://localhost/broker/rest/domains

    No auth is required for the following APIs:
    curl -k https://localhost/broker/rest/application_templates
    curl -k https://localhost/broker/rest/cartridges
    curl -k https://localhost/broker/rest/api

=== KNOWN ISSUES ===
* I need to port the conf stub to actually use
  /etc/stickshift/plugins.d/openshift-origin-auth-remote-user.conf.

* We need the /etc/stickshift/plugins.d commit to correctly have the gem
  picked up in the Gemfile without manual intervention.
