Feature: HAProxy Application Sub-Cartridge
  
  Scenario Outline: Create Delete one application with haproxy
    Given a new <type> type application
    Then a <proc_name> process will be running
    
    When I embed a haproxy-1.4 cartridge into the application
    Then 1 process named haproxy will be running
    And the embedded haproxy-1.4 cartridge directory will exist
    And the haproxy configuration file will exist
    And the haproxy PATH override will exist

    When I destroy the application
    Then 0 processes named haproxy will be running
    And a <proc_name> process will not be running
    And the embedded haproxy-1.4 cartridge directory will not exist
    And the haproxy configuration file will not exist
