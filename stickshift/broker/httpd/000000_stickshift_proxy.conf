#
# This configuration is to run the StickShift site in
# a separate httpd instance.  This is done primarily
# for our development environment where graceful
# restarts on the primary instance are required.
#
# Passenger will sever connections, returning 500
# exceptions, when graceful restarting under load.
#
# If that is not your use case and you would rather
# run a dedicated instance of Passenger, your
# configuration would be as shown below.  Also, in
# this configuration, you would typically need to
# create a symbolic link from /var/www/stickshift/site/public
# to /var/www/html/app
#   ln -s /var/www/stickshift/site/public /var/www/html/app
#
# RailsBaseURI /app
# PassengerUser stickshift_passenger
# PassengerMaxPoolSize 20
