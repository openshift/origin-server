.SH DESCRIPTION

This administrative utility fixes occasional problems with user
application operations such as start/stop/add cartridges, which are queued
under pending_op_groups inside each application. In the case of certain
bugs, a particular pending_op_group may fail and become stuck at the head
of the queue; the broker will keep operating on it and cannot continue
to process any other operations for that application. This may result
in users being denied all broker operations for that particular app.
.PP
This script clears stale entries from the pending op queues of applications.
