SYNOPSIS
  oo-admin-move --gear_uuid gear-uuid 
  [--change_district]
  [--destination_district_uuid district-uuid]
  [-i|--target_server_identity server-identity]
  [-p|--node_profile node-profile] [-t|--timeout time-out]

  oo-admin-move -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
  Used to move a gear to a different node. With no options, an active
  node in the same district is selected. Options specify different or
  more specific destinations for the gear.

  A gear's numeric UID can not be changed during a move. When moving
  between districts or between undistricted nodes, the gear's numeric UID
  must be available in the destination district or on the undistricted
  node.

  When moving within a district, use one of two methods: either specify
  a destination host for the gear, or deactivate the source node in the
  district to keep it from being selected as the destination (this is
  useful for emptying a node that will be decommissioned).

OPTIONS
  -h|--help  
    Display a simple help dialog.
  
  --gear_uuid gear-uuid  
    Gear uuid to move. Alphanumeric, canonical way to identify the gear.

  --change_district  
    Move the gear to a district different from its current district.

  --destination_district_uuid district-uuid  
    Move the gear to a specific destination district with given uuid.

  -i|--target_server_identity server-identity  
    Move the gear to a specific server identity (hostname).

  -p|--node_profile node-profile  
    Move the gear to a node with the given profile.

  -t|--timeout time-out  
    Timeout value for the move.
