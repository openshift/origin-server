.SH DESCRIPTION
Coordinates upgrade of cartridges across all nodes. Designed around the principal that each gear upgrade is reentrant 
and can be retried multiple times. The primary use case is to call upgrade-node with no server_identity. Each run tracks 
failure and success for each gear and each subsequent run of upgrade-node picks up where the previous run left off until
all gears are successfully upgraded.
