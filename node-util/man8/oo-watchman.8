.SH NAME
oo-watchman \- monitor the status and state of gears and cartridges
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "/etc/init.d/openshift-watchman {start|stop|restart|status}"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "oo-watchman"
Provides a plugin framework for monitoring the status and state of gears/cartridges on a node.
.P
Plugins inherit from the base class \fBWatchmanPlugin\fR implementing the optional methods
\fIinitialize()\fR and \fIapply()\fR.
The methods \fIidle()\fR, \fIstop()\fR, and \fIrestart()\fR are provided for
plugins to idle a gear, stop a gear or restart a gear. Stop attempts to just stop the running cartridge
daemons so operations like \fIgit push\fR should not be effected.
.P
A plugin may request a gear to change state no more than \fBGEAR_RETRIES\fR times within the \fBRETRY_PERIOD\fR
but no sooner than \fBRETRY_DELAY\fR. Additional requests made within the \fBRETRY_DELAY\fR or then the
\fBRETRY_PERIOD\fR are ignored.
.P
The scripts /etc/init.d/openshift-watchman and openshift-watchman.service are provided to start oo-watchman.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The program only returns when an exception is thrown
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH EXAMPLE
.P
The \fBSyslogPlugin\fR searches /var/log/messages for messages logged by cgroups when killing off a gear.
The gear is restarted, if needed.
.P
The \fBJbossPlugin\fR searches JBoss cartridges' server.log files for OutOfMemoryExceptions.
The gear is restarted, if needed.
.P
The \fBGearStatePlugin\fR attempts to ensure the current application state matches
the last state change for the application commanded by the user. It will restart applications
that have failed, or stop applications that are still running.
.P
The \fBThrottlerPlugin\fR monitors CPU usage via cgroups and restricts usage, if needed.
