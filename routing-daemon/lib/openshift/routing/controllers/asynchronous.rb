    # are stored in @members using one string of the form address:port to
    # represent each pool member.
    #
    # The initializer can optionally be passed false for its fourth
    # argument to prevent it from querying the load balancer for the

    # AsyncLoadBalancerController is designed to be used with a load balancer
    # that provide an asynchronous interface.  Operations such as creating and
    # deleting pools, pool members, and routing rules are submitted to the load
    # balancer, which returns a list of job ids and performs the operations
    # asynchronously.
    #
    # It is our responsibility to ensure that we defer operations that depend on
    # other operations until the load balancer reports that the latter
    # operations are complete.  To that end, we maintain a table of submitted
    # operations, where each Operation corresponds to an operation that is to be
    # or has been submitted to the load balancer.
    #
    # When we are told to carry out an operation, first we check whether it must
    # wait for any Operation in @ops.  We set @blocked_on_cnt of the new
    # Operation to the number of operations on which it must wait, append the
    # new Operation to the @blocked_ops of the corresponding Operation objects,
    # and add the new Operation to @ops.
    #
    # If an Operation has an empty jobids, then it has not been submitted to
    # the load balancer.  If an Operation has non-empty jobids, then it has
    # been submitted to the load balancer and is in progress.
    #
    # If an Operation has not been submitted to the load balancer but has a zero
    # @blocked_on_cnt, then it is ready to be submitted.
    #
    # We periodically submit all ready Operation objects in @ops (i.e., those
    # that have zero @blocked_on_cnt and empty @jobids) to the load balancer.
    # When an operation is submitted, we assign the job ids returned by the load
    # balancer to @jobids of the corresponding Operation objects.
    #
    # We can poll the load balancer using the poll_async_jobs method.  When the
    # load balancer reports that some job has finished, we delete that job from
    # @jobids of the Operation.  If @jobids is empty, then the Operation has
    # completed.
    #
    # When an Operation completes, we check its @blocked_ops attribute,
    # decrement the @blocked_on_cnt for each Operation therein, and delete the
    # completed Operation from @ops.
    #
    # Although we try to ensure that a given operation is not submitted to the
    # load balancer before the load balancer has completed all operations on
    # which the first operation depends, we do not necessarily handle
    # out-of-order events.  
    # Because we only ever make a new Operation block on existing Operation
    # objects, deadlocks are not possible.
