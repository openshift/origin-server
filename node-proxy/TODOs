Only for build/docs -- need dox (optional) -- need an rpm for it or
npm install it in the build.


Bugs/TODOs:
1. vhost throttling
2. access logger
3. idler use node-proxy access logs
3.1  idling/restoring app change routes.json endpoint to $vhost:80
5. haproxy - set max connections to -1 - since # of gears is dynamic (up/down).
6. migration - will need route*json files for:
    a.  aliases
    b.  normal 00000_default.conf
7. service file for Fedora (F17)


And further: 
999. next gen routing release (when we bind to port 80/443):
   - phpmyadmin/rockmongo/metrics -- write a route.json file for these carts.
   - proxy migration - route*json files for phpmyadmin/rockmongo/metrics
