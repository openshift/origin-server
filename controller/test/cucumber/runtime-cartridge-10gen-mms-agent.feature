Feature: 10gen-mms-agent Embedded Cartridge

  Scenario: 10gen-mms-agent Embedded Cartridge
    Given a new mock-0.1 type application
    And I embed a mongodb-2.2 cartridge into the application
    And an agent settings.py file is created
    And I embed a 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge into the application

    Then 1 process named python will be running
    And the embedded 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge log files will exist

    When I stop the 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge
    Then 0 processes named python will be running

    When I start the 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge
    Then 1 processes named python will be running

    When I restart the 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge
    Then 1 processes named python will be running

    When I destroy the application
    Then 0 processes named python will be running
    And the embedded 10gen-mms-agent-0.1 cartridge log files will not exist
