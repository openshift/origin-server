Feature: V2 SDK Mock Cartridge

  # Basic tests without broker, mcollective, or rhc

  Scenario: Exercise basic platform functionality
    Given a v2 default node
    Given a new mock type application
    Then the application git repo will exist
    And the platform-created default environment variables will exist
    And the mock cartridge private endpoints will be exposed
    And the mock setup_called marker will exist
    And the mock setup_version marker will not exist
    And the mock MOCK_VERSION env entry will not exist
    And the mock setup_failure marker will not exist
    And the mock MOCK_EXAMPLE env entry will exist
    And the mock MOCK_SERVICE_URL env entry will exist

    When I start the application
    Then the mock control_start marker will exist

    When I status the application
    Then the mock control_status marker will exist

    When I stop the application
    Then the mock control_stop marker will exist

    When I restart the application
    Then the mock control_restart marker will exist

    When I destroy the application
    Then the application git repo will not exist

  # Scenario: Update application
  # Scenario: Add cartridge w/ user-specified repo
  # Scenario: Move
  # Scenario: Tidy
  # Scenario: Access via SSH

  # Client tools tests

  Scenario: Create and exercise application with client tools
    Given a v2 default node
    And the libra client tools
    And an accepted node
    When 1 mock applications are created
    # Then the applications should be accessible # Mock needs to serve HTTP for this step to work

  # Plugin tests

  Scenario: Add/Remove mock plugin to/from mock application
    Given a v2 default node
    Given a new mock type application
    When I embed a mock-plugin cartridge into the application
    Then the mock-plugin cartridge private endpoints will be exposed
    And the mock-plugin setup_called marker will exist
    And the mock-plugin setup_version marker will not exist
    And the mock-plugin setup_failure marker will not exist
    And the mock-plugin MOCK_PLUGIN_EXAMPLE env entry will exist
    And the mock-plugin MOCK_PLUGIN_SERVICE_URL env entry will exist
    When I remove the mock-plugin cartridge from the application
    Then the mock-plugin teardown_called marker will exist
    And the mock-plugin cartridge private endpoints will be concealed
