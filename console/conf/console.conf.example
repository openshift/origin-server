#
# The base URL for the OpenShift REST API on the broker. If your
# environment is configured with a virtual host security module that
# bypasses normal authentication, be sure to set that virtual host
# here.
#
# Required
#
BROKER_URL=https://localhost/broker/rest


#
# A proxy URL to use when connecting with the broker.
#
# Optional
#
# BROKER_PROXY_URL=

#
# The base URL of the community wiki site.
#
# Optional
#
# COMMUNITY_URL=https://www.openshift.com/

# When set, any absolute URLs that are generated will use this host
# DEFAULT_URL_OPTIONS_HOST=openshift.redhat.com

# When set, any absolute URLs that are generated will use this port
# When set to nothing no port will be specified on the URL
# DEFAULT_URL_OPTIONS_PORT=

# The server url hosting the static assets for the console
# ASSET_HOST=https://openshift.redhat.com

# The URL to use for logging a user out of the console
# When set to nothing, no logout link is displayed
# LOGOUT_LINK=

#
# SSL settings for the connection between the console and broker.
# Specified as a Ruby hash of options to be passed to Net::HTTP.
#
# Optional, will use the default Ruby environment settings
#
# No certificate checking (INSECURE, use only in trusted networks):
# BROKER_API_SSL_OPTIONS={:verify_mode => OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE}
#
# Perform cert checking and require SSLv3 (some Mac environments may
# need this set):
# BROKER_API_SSL_OPTIONS={:verify_mode => OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER, :ssl_version => :SSLv3}


#
# The type of security mode that OpenShift should use.  There are
# two provided modules and the ability to specify a custom class.
#
# basic
#   When a user accesses the console through a browser, the console
#   will force BASIC authentication, and then pass that info on
#   to the broker.
#
# remote_user
#   The console is configured to check for the presence of one or
#   more headers on incoming requests in order to determine whether
#   a user is secure.  Headers may be copied along to the remote
#   server.
#
#   Intended for use with mod_auth and other similar REMOTE_USER
#   concepts in HTTP servers, where an HTTP proxy may handle
#   authentication and then forward the request with information
#   about the authenticated user.
#
# <class name>
#   The name of a class to load that will provide a security
#   implementation usable by the console.  See 
#   Console::Auth::RemoteUser for an example of a secure
#   implementation.  The class will be required by Ruby code
#   during startup of the console and any errors will prevent
#   load.
#
CONSOLE_SECURITY=basic


#
# The name of the request env variable or header that indicates a 
# user is authenticated.  This value will be used as the display 
# name for the user unless remote_user_name_header is set.
#
# The value you provide here will be the key used to access the
# Rack environment.  All keys must be uppercase, and headers must
# be prefixed with "HTTP_".  Without that prefix, the value will
# assumed to be set by Passenger into the environment.
#
# When using mod_auth this value is normally set to 'REMOTE_USER'
#
# To read the HTTP request header 'X-Remote-User', set this to 
# 'HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER'.
#
# Required when CONSOLE_SECURITY=remote_user
#
# REMOTE_USER_HEADER=REMOTE_USER


#
# When using remote_user security, the value of the authentication
# header may not be human readable or intended for display.  This 
# optional setting will first check for the presence of 
# REMOTE_USER_HEADER and then if this header is present, use it as
# the visible user name.  If the header is missing, the value of
# REMOTE_USER_HEADER will be shown instead.  This a Rack environment
# variable and so must follow the same rules as REMOTE_USER_HEADER.
#
# Optional
#
# REMOTE_USER_NAME_HEADER=HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER_NAME


#
# A list of headers to pass from the incoming request to the API
# calls made against the broker for preserving authentication state.
# Separate header names with commas. The console will simply copy 
# these values without inspection.
#
# Required when CONSOLE_SECURITY=remote_user, may be empty
#
# REMOTE_USER_COPY_HEADERS=X-Remote-User,Cookies


#
# Should log messages be sent to syslog instead of a log file
#
# Optional
#
# SYSLOG_ENABLED=true
