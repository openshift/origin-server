      '104': You have reached the maximum allowed gears and cannot create another.  You must scale down an application or remove an application or cartridge to continue.
      '116': Your SSH public key appears to be invalid.  Keys should start with a type (usually ssh-rsa or ssh-dsa), a blank space, and then a long string of numbers and letters.
      '121': You have already saved this public key with a different name. Provide a different key here.
      '151': You must create a Jenkins application (to act as a build server) before you can add the Jenkins cartridge to an application.
      '153': You are currently using more gears than the new plan would allow.  Please scale down or delete applications before downgrading.
