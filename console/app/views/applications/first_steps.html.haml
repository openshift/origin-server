  %p.lead OpenShift helps you build and deploy web applications, mobile backends, service oriented architectures, and host your favorite services.

  -#%p.larger 
    An <strong>application</strong> in OpenShift has a public web address that sends incoming web traffic to code you write and upload. If you need to handle more traffic, you can run multiple copies of your web code through <strong>scaling</strong>.  Need a database?  Each application can get a private MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL database by adding a <strong>cartridge</strong>.
