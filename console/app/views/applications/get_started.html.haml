          %p
            Before you can upload code, you need to provide us with a <strong>public key</strong>
            to identify you to our servers. If this is your first time creating a public key
            #{link_to "read more about SSH keys and remote access", ssh_keys_help_path}.

      %p 
        OpenShift uses the #{link_to "Git version control system", git_homepage_url}
        to manage the code of your application. Each cartridge has a single Git <strong>repository</strong>
        that you'll use to check in changes to your application. When you <strong>push</strong>
        a change to your Git repository we'll automatically deploy your code and restart your 
        application if necessary.

                git clone #{@application.git_url}
                cd #{@application.name}/
          %p 
            This will create a folder with the source code of your application. After making a change,
            %strong add,
            %strong commit,
            and

                git push

          %p 
            When you push changes the OpenShift server will report back its status on deploying your code. 
            The server will run any of your configured

      Cartridges are the components of an OpenShift application, and include databases, build systems,
      and management capabilities. <strong>#{link_to 'Adding a cartridge', application_cartridge_types_path(@application)}</strong> such as 
      #{link_to 'MySQL', application_cartridge_type_path(@application, 'mysql-5.1')} or #{link_to 'MongoDB', application_cartridge_type_path(@application, 'mongodb-2.2')}
      to an application provides the desired capability without forcing you to administrate or update that feature.

      Most of the capabilities of OpenShift are exposed through our command line tool,

      Whether it's adding cartridges, checking uptime, or pulling log files from
      the server, you can quickly put a finger on the pulse of your application.

    %p
      The JBoss Developer Studio is a full featured IDE with OpenShift integration built in.
      It gives you the ability to create, edit and deploy applications without having to
      leave the IDE.  Links to download, install and use the JBoss Developer Studio for Linux,
      Mac OS X, or Windows can be found on the
