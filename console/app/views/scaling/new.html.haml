%h1 Not Scalable

%section
  %p
    This application is not currently scalable. For the time being 
    applications must be set to scale when they are created. To make a 
    new application scalable you will need to pass the command line 
    option <code>--scale</code>:
    
  %pre.cli 
    rhc create-app --scaling -a &lt;your application&gt; ...

  %p
    or select "scaling" from the advanced options on the Create Application page.

  %p
    For more information about scaling your applications see
    #{link_to 'our scaling guide in the Developer Center', scaling_help_url}.

  %p 
    We hope to add the ability to enable scaling on existing applications in the 
    future - you can provide feedback about this and other features in 
    OpenShift via our #{link_to 'feature request page', suggest_features_url}.
