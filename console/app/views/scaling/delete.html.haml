%h1 Disable Scaling

%section
  %p
    Your application is currently set to scale the web cartridge.  
    At this time applications that scale cannot have scaling disabled.
    You must create a new application and migrate your source code if 
    you wish to remove the high availability proxy cartridge that 
    provides scaling.

    We hope to add this feature in the future - you can provide feedback
    about this and other features in OpenShift via our #{link_to 'feature request page', suggest_features_url}.
