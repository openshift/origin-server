  %p 
    OpenShift is configured to build this application with 
    #{link_to 'Jenkins', jenkins_help_url } when you make 
    changes through Git. If you remove the Jenkins cartridge
    your build history and results are preserved, but new 
    changes to Git will no longer start builds.

  %p 
    Are you sure you wish to disable builds for this 
    application?
