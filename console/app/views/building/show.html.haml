%h1 Building your Application

%section
  %p OpenShift is configured to build this application with #{link_to 'Jenkins', jenkins_help_url } when you make changes through Git. You can track the progress of builds through the following Jenkins job:

  %p.well.application-url.larger
    = link_to @application.build_job_url, @application.build_job_url

  %p If you no longer wish to run Jenkins builds, you can #{link_to "remove the Jenkins cartridge", delete_application_building_path(@application) }.
