Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

disable_auto_scaling - Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up 
                       or down according to application load.

enable_jpda - Will enable the JPDA socket based transport on the java virtual
              machine running Ceylon. This enables you to remotely debug code.
