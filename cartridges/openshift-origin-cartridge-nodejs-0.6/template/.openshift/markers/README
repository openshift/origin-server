Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

force_clean_build - Will remove any previously installed npm modules and
                    re-install all the required modules from scratch
                    
hot_deploy - Will run Node with Supervisor (https://npmjs.org/package/supervisor)
			 so that changes to javascript files will be reloaded without requiring
			 a restart of Node. NOTE: Node will be restarted and started with Supervisor
			 the first time the hot_deploy marker appears

disable_auto_scaling - Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up 
                       or down according to application load.
