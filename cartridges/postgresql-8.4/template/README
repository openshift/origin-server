Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
sql/ - SQL data or scripts.
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME']  - Application name
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR']   - Application dir
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc app cartridge add', you can reference environment
variables for username, host and password:

    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave sql and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items in ../data which will persist between pushes of
your repo.
