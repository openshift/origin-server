Repo layout
===========
php/ - Externally exposed PHP code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For PHP code that should not be accessible by end users
deplist.txt - list of pears to install

Notes about layout
==================
OpenShift will look for the php and libs directories when serving your 
application. index.php will handle requests to the root URL of your 
application. You can create new directories as needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir is recreated.
      Please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the OpenShift
      data directory, which will persist between pushes of your repo.
      The OpenShift data directory is accessible relative to the remote repo
      directory (../data) or via an environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can reference
environment variables for username, host and password. Example for mysql:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

When embedding a NoSQL database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can
reference environment variables for username, host and password.
Example for MongoDB:
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST']      - NoSQL DB Host
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT']      - NoSQL DB Port
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_USERNAME']  - NoSQL DB Username
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD']  - NoSQL DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, consult the OpenShift documentation.


deplist.txt
===========

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
