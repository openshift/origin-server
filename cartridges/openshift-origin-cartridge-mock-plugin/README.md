# OpenShift Mock Plugin Cartridge

This is a mock implementation of the [OpenShift cartridge API](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/README.writing_cartridges.md)
which is used to test the OpenShift node platform functionality.  The mock cartridges maintains a store
of what actions have been performed and provides methods to test for those actions.
