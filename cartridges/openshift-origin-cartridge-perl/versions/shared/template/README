Repo layout
===========
perl/ - Externally exposed perl code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed perl code
deplist.txt - A list of perl modules required to run

Notes about layout
==================
Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated, please
store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the OpenShift data
directory, which will persist between pushes of your repo.
The OpenShift data directory is accessible relative to the remote repo
directory (../data) or via an environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR'}  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR'}   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

When embedding a database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can reference environment
variables for username, host and password:

    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST'}      - DB host
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT'}      - DB Port
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME'}  - DB Username
    $ENV{'OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD'}  - DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, consult the OpenShift documentation.


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave perl, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


deplist.txt
===========

Adding module names to deplist.txt causes your remote OpenShift node to download
the required modules and install them.
