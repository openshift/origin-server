Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
tmp/ - Temporary storage
public/ - Content (images, css, etc. available to the public)
config.ru - This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application.
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted

Notes about layout
==================
Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated, please
store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the OpenShift data
directory, which will persist between pushes of your repo.
The OpenShift data directory is accessible relative to the remote repo
directory (../data) or via an environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR.


Ruby Mirror
===========
OpenShift is mirroring rubygems.org at http://mirror1.ops.rhcloud.com/mirror/ruby/
This mirror is on the same network as your application, and your gem download should be faster.
To use the OpenShift mirror:

Edit your Gemfile and replace
  source 'http://rubygems.org'
with
  source 'http://mirror1.ops.rhcloud.com/mirror/ruby/'

Edit your Gemfile.lock and replace
  remote: http://rubygems.org/
with
  remote: http://mirror1.ops.rhcloud.com/mirror/ruby/


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']  - Application name

When embedding a database using 'rhc app cartridge add', you can reference
environment variables for username, host and password. Example for mysql:

    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

When embedding a NoSQL database using 'rhc app cartridge add', you can
reference environment variables for username, host and password.
Example for MongoDB:
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST']      - NoSQL DB Host
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT']      - NoSQL DB Port
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_USERNAME']  - NoSQL DB Username
    ENV['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD']  - NoSQL DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.

Every time you push, everything in your remote application path gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Rails 3.0
===========

Option 1) (Recommended) Git push your application Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.  This will 
cause the remote OpenShift node to run bundle install --deployment to download and 
install your dependencies.  Each subsequent git push will use the previously
downloaded dependencies as a starting point, so additional downloads will be a delta.

Option 2) Git add your .bundle and vendor/bundle directories after running
'bundle install --deployment' locally.  Be sure to exclude any gems that have native 
code or ensure they can run on RHEL x86_64.
