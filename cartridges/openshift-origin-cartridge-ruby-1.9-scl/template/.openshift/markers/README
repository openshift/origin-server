Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

force_clean_build - Previous output from bundle install --deployment will be
     removed and all gems will be reinstalled according to the current
     Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.

hot_deploy - Will prevent the apache process from being restarted during
    build/deployment. Note that mod_passenger will respawn the Rack worker
    processes if any code has been modified.

disable_auto_scaling - Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up 
                       or down according to application load.
