# This hook is what drives the initial shutdown of the application prior to 
# applying incoming commits. Because it must respect the presence of the
# hot_deploy marker, this becomes a bit tricky as we must take into account
# the possibility that the marker is being added or removed during the
# commit, possibly for the first time. The stop should only occur if the
# marker is present and will remain present after the commit is applied.
