Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Get started
===========
1. Add framework of choice to your repo.
2. Modify .openshift/action_hooks/start to start your application.
   The application is required to bind to $OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP:8080.
3. Modify .openshift/action_hooks/stop to stop your application.
4. Commit and push your changes.

Repo layout
===========
static/ - Externally exposed static content goes here
.openshift/action_hooks/start - Script that gets run to start your application
.openshift/action_hooks/stop - Script that gets run to stop your application
.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build - Script that gets run every git push before the build
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted

Notes about layout
==================
Please leave the static directory in place (alter but do not delete) but feel
free to create additional directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
      please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the OpenShift
      data directory, which will persist between pushes of your repo.
      The OpenShift data directory is accessible relative to the remote repo
      directory (../data) or via an environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP']  - IP Address assigned to the application
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME']  - Application name
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DIR']   - Application dir
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.
