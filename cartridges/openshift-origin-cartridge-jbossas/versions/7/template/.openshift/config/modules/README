Place your JBoss AS7 modules in this directory. This directory is added to the
module path of the AS7 server associated with your application. It has the
same structure as the standard AS7 modules directory.

The modules placed in this directory will be added to or override the default modules
provided by the OpenShift JBoss AS7 cartridge.

Scenarios:
1) Replace a default module with a new module that contains a bug fix or new feature
2) Add a module that does not exist in the base OpenShift AS7 cartridge in order to add
a new component. Typically these new modules will need to be enabled and configured in
standalone.xml

Unless one of the above scenarios is required there is no need to modify the 
modules directory.

NOTE: Replacing default modules as in scenario 1 can cause conflicts between modules so
should be done with caution and adequate testing.
