# OpenShift Mock Cartridge

This is a mock implementation of the [OpenShift Cartridge API](http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html) which is used to test the OpenShift node platform functionality. The mock cartridges maintains a store of what actions have been performed and provides methods to test for those actions.  

This cartridge was intentionally omitted from the [OpenShift Cartridge Guide](http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html).
