Repo layout
===========
wsgi/ - Externally exposed wsgi code goes
wsgi/static/ - Public static content gets served here
libs/ - Additional libraries
data/ - For not-externally exposed wsgi code
setup.py - Standard setup.py, specify deps here

Notes about layout
==================
Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated, please
store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the OpenShift data
directory, which will persist between pushes of your repo.
The OpenShift data directory is accessible relative to the remote repo
directory (../data) or via an environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.


When embedding a database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can reference
environment variables for username, host and password. Example for mysql:

    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST']      - DB host
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT']      - DB Port
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME']  - DB Username
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD']  - DB Password

When embedding a NoSQL database using 'rhc cartridge add', you can
reference environment variables for username, host and password.
Example for MongoDB:
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST']      - NoSQL DB Host
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT']      - NoSQL DB Port
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_USERNAME']  - NoSQL DB Username
    os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD']  - NoSQL DB Password

To get a full list of environment variables, consult the OpenShift documentation.


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave wsgi, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Notes about setup.py
====================

Adding deps to the install_requires will have the openshift server actually
install those deps at git push time.
